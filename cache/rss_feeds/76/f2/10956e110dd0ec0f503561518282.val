         <title>Placental Gene Expression Associated With Early Childhood Growth Trajectories and Obesity Risk</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT

Objective
This study aimed to investigate the association of placental gene expression with early childhood growth trajectories and obesity risk.


Methods
We analyzed 794 children from the Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Learning in Early Childhood study. Placental samples collected at delivery underwent RNA sequencing to obtain transcriptome data. BMI trajectories from birth to 4 years (rising‐high‐, moderate‐, and low‐BMI) and overweight/obesity at 4 years were the childhood outcomes of interest. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with the outcomes were identified using DESeq2. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed on DEGs. Their causal relationships with outcomes were explored using the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.


Results
We identified 22 and 23 DEGs associated with BMI trajectories and overweight/obesity, respectively, with false discovery rates (FDR) &lt; 0.05. Pathway analysis of these DEGs identified 26 biological pathways, primarily related to the immune system. MR analysis suggested that one (SSX2B) and eight DEGs (e.g., HSPA1A, DNAJB1) might be causally associated with the BMI trajectories and overweight/obesity (FDR &lt; 0.05), respectively.


Conclusions
This study identified placental gene expression associated with early childhood growth outcomes. These findings suggest the potential important role of placental immune system genes in the development of childhood obesity.

         <title>Effect of unprocessed red meat on obesity and related factors: A systematic review and meta‐analysis</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta‐analysis of intervention trials that have determined the effect of unprocessed red meat (URM) intake on obesity‐related outcomes.


Methods
The populations, interventions, controls, and outcomes (PICO) framework was used to create questions to search seven databases from July 29, 2020, to August 21, 2020. Two reviewers independently screened 5630 references. English‐language intervention trials in adults testing the effect of URM on obesity‐related outcomes were included. Twenty‐four studies met selection criteria. A random‐effects model was developed to calculate pooled effect sizes. The DerSimonian‐Laird estimator was used to estimate the variance of the true effect sizes. An interactive dashboard was published to provide transparent analysis and data presentation.


Results
We found no significant effect of URM for BMI, body weight, or percent body fat based on unfiltered pooled effect sizes. Filtered pooled effect size analysis showed a slight adverse effect of URM for total cholesterol and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol.


Conclusions
Studies did not show an effect of URM on weight gain, obesity, or related metabolic conditions. This may help clinicians when considering the use of URM for patients. Longer studies may be needed for observing obesity development in case the effect of URM on weight gain is small and needs a much longer time to express.

         <title>An eHealth Intervention in Pregnancy on Maternal Body Composition and Subsequent Perinatal Outcomes: A Randomized Trial</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT

Objective
To examine the effects of a pragmatic multicomponent eHealth intervention in pregnancy on body composition changes and subsequent associations with perinatal outcomes.


Methods
Pregnant individuals (n = 351) enrolled in Louisiana's Women, Infants, and Children program were randomly assigned to a multicomponent eHealth Intervention or Usual Care. Fat percentage, fat mass, and fat‐free mass were assessed using bioelectrical impedance at trimester‐specific study visits. Mixed models evaluated within‐ and between‐group differences in body composition from early to late pregnancy: overall, by BMI, and by gestational weight gain (GWG) guideline attainment. Effects of body composition changes on perinatal outcomes was evaluated.


Results
Compared to Usual Care (n = 172), the Intervention Group (n = 179) had attenuated gains in fat mass, fat mass index, and fat percentage from early to late pregnancy overall, in individuals who had normal weight at enrollment, and in those who exceeded GWG guidelines (p &lt; 0.05). No significant between‐group differences in fat‐free mass were observed. Fat mass change interacted with intervention effects on neonatal health outcomes (p = 0.01).


Conclusions
Lifestyle interventions during pregnancy may attenuate gestational fat mass gain, particularly among women with normal weight and those who exceed GWG guidelines, with potential implications for neonatal health outcomes.

         <title>Risk for cancer after bariatric surgery compared with the general population: a nationwide matched cohort study</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
Our objective was to evaluate how the incidence of cancer after metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) compared with the general population.


Methods
A nationwide cohort of patients who underwent MBS in Sweden from 2007 to 2020 were matched (age, sex, area of residence) to controls from the general population. All patients were followed for new incidence of cancer.


Results
Among the 68,424 patients who underwent MBS compared with the 640,944 controls, there was no difference in the risk for new onset of cancer (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.99–1.07). Compared with controls, MBS was associated with a lower risk for breast cancer in women (IRR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.71–0.86) and nonmelanoma (IRR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.59–0.85) and melanoma (IRR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.68–0.87) skin cancer in men and women, but an increased risk remained for colon cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, corpus uteri cancer, renal cancer, malignant meningioma, and non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma.


Conclusions
All‐cancer incidence risk was similar between patients who underwent MBS and the general population. Although breast and skin cancer risk was lower among MBS patients compared with controls, MBS patients had a greater risk for multiple cancer types. Thus, patients who have undergone MBS should continue recommended cancer screening and clinically approved work‐up for cancer symptoms as recommended for the general population.

         <title>Breastfeeding, genetic susceptibility, and type 2 diabetes in offspring in later life</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
Our objective was to assess the prospective association between breastfeeding and the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in offspring and to investigate the joint effects of breastfeeding and genetic susceptibility on T2D risk.


Methods
We included 364,562 participants free from prevalent T2D from the UK Biobank. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the association between breastfeeding and incident T2D.


Results
Over a median follow‐up of 12 years, 12,795 cases of incident T2D were recorded. Ever breastfeeding was associated with a significantly lower risk of T2D compared with never breastfeeding (hazard ratio = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89–0.99). Additionally, significant interaction effects on T2D risk were observed between breastfeeding and T2D genetic risk score (T2D‐GRS), both multiplicatively and additively. The association between T2D‐GRS and risk of T2D was stronger in participants who were never breastfed compared with those who were breastfed (p for multiplicative interaction = 0.040). The risk of T2D associated with never breastfeeding combined with a high T2D‐GRS was greater than the sum of the risks associated with each individual factor (p for additive interaction = 0.007).


Conclusions
Breastfeeding is associated with a lower risk of incident T2D in offspring, showing both multiplicative and additive interactions with T2D‐GRS.

&lt;p&gt;Our objective was to assess the prospective association between breastfeeding and the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in offspring and to investigate the joint effects of breastfeeding and genetic susceptibility on T2D risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 364,562 participants free from prevalent T2D from the UK Biobank. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the association between breastfeeding and incident T2D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a median follow-up of 12 years, 12,795 cases of incident T2D were recorded. Ever breastfeeding was associated with a significantly lower risk of T2D compared with never breastfeeding (hazard ratio = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89–0.99). Additionally, significant interaction effects on T2D risk were observed between breastfeeding and T2D genetic risk score (T2D-GRS), both multiplicatively and additively. The association between T2D-GRS and risk of T2D was stronger in participants who were never breastfed compared with those who were breastfed (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; for multiplicative interaction = 0.040). The risk of T2D associated with never breastfeeding combined with a high T2D-GRS was greater than the sum of the risks associated with each individual factor (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; for additive interaction = 0.007).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breastfeeding is associated with a lower risk of incident T2D in offspring, showing both multiplicative and additive interactions with T2D-GRS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficacy and Safety of GLP‐1 Receptor Agonists, Dual Agonists, and Retatrutide for Weight Loss in Adults With Overweight or Obesity: A Bayesian NMA</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Retatrutide and dual agonists achieved similar mean weight loss (−11.0 kg), surpassing GLP‐1RAs (−9.0 kg). Retatrutide was more effective in attaining 〉 15% weight loss from baseline, but with a higher risk of adverse effects, while dual agonists offer a favorable efficacy‐safety balance.

ABSTRACT

Objective
To compare the efficacy and safety of GLP‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs), dual agonists (GLP‐1RAs/GIP or GCGR), and retatrutide (GLP‐1/GIP/glucagon) for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity.


Methods
We conducted a systematic review and Bayesian network meta‐analysis (NMA) of 19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 29,506 adults (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2), assessing liraglutide, semaglutide, survodutide, tirzepatide, retatrutide, and placebo. Outcomes included mean weight loss, achievement of ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and ≥ 15% weight loss, waist circumference (WC), BMI, and adverse events (AEs) at ≥ 36 weeks. Subgroup and meta‐regression analyses evaluated the impact of diabetes status, sex, age, and BMI.


Results
Retatrutide and dual agonists achieved equivalent mean weight loss (−11.0 kg), surpassing GLP‐1RAs (−9.0 kg), with retatrutide excelling at achieving ≥ 15% weight loss (OR 54.6). Dual agonists and GLP‐1RAs followed (OR 16.4 and 9.0, respectively). Retatrutide had the highest AE risk. Meta‐regression showed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) reduced weight loss by 4.338 kg for GLP‐1RAs and 5.016 kg for dual agonists, with enhanced outcomes in female‐dominant or high‐BMI cohorts.


Conclusions
Retatrutide offers superior weight loss efficacy but with a higher AE risk. Dual agonists provide a favorable efficacy–safety balance. Personalized treatment selection based on patient characteristics is recommended.

         <title>Association of body composition trajectories with changes in cognitive performance in the Look AHEAD study</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
The objective of this study was to investigate the longitudinal association of total body fat and appendicular lean mass (ALM), as well as sarcopenia, with cognitive decline after weight loss intervention.


Methods
Among 972 Look AHEAD‐MIND participants with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, we investigated the longitudinal association of dual‐energy x‐ray absorptiometry body composition trajectories with cognitive change. We identified three latent trajectories each for total body fat and ALM. Mixed linear regression models were adjusted for the following: repeated measures; order of cognitive test; years from randomization; randomization arm; age; sex; race and ethnicity; and education. We also investigated differences in cognitive score by sarcopenia and BMI categories.


Results
A gradual decrease in total body fat and no decrease in ALM were significantly independently associated with higher cognitive scores compared with other trajectories. Differences in cognitive score were large for sarcopenia, but not for obesity. Full adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic factors substantially attenuated the estimates.


Conclusions
Weight loss approaches that preserve ALM and function may lead to reduced cognitive decline compared with weight loss alone. The improved ability to target interventions toward those who are more resilient to aging‐related body composition changes may prevent unintended consequences of weight loss.

         <title>Early meal timing attenuates high polygenic risk of obesity</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract

Objective
We examined whether meal timing is associated with long‐term weight‐loss maintenance and whether meal timing interacts with a genome‐wide polygenic score (PRS‐BMI) on body weight‐related outcomes. We then examined the interaction of meal timing with 97 BMI‐related single‐nucleotide polymorphisms on obesity outcome.


Methods
Participants (N = 1195, mean age 41.07 [SD 12.68] years, female 80.8%, baseline mean BMI 31.32 [SD 5.53] kg/m2) were adults with overweight or obesity from the Obesity, Nutrigenetics, Timing, and Mediterranean (ONTIME) study. We developed a PRS‐BMI to assess the genetic risk for obesity and estimated the timing of the midpoint of meal intake. We also calculated the success in long‐term weight‐loss maintenance after a dietary obesity treatment (at least 3 years). Linear regression analyses were performed for association and interaction assessments.


Results
Each hour of delay in meal timing was associated with 2.2% higher long‐term body weight (β [SE] = 2.177% [1.067%]; p = 0.042) (i.e., with lower weight‐loss maintenance following dietary obesity treatment). There was a significant interaction between meal timing and PRS‐BMI (p = 0.008); BMI increased by more than 2 kg/m2 for every hour of delay in meal timing in individuals with high PRS‐BMI (β [SE] = 2.208 [0.502] kg/m2; p = 1.0E‐5), whereas no associations were evident for those with lower genetic risk.


Conclusions
Meal timing is associated with weight‐loss maintenance and may influence the association between obesity genetics and BMI. Findings underscore the importance of personalized obesity management.

         <title>Gap of women leadership in global obesity research</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study aims to evaluate and summarize the current state of gender equality for female scientists in obesity research.







Abstract

Objective
This study aims to evaluate and summarize the current state of gender equality for female scientists in obesity research.


Methods
We conducted a comprehensive analysis of governmental funding, high‐impact publications/citations, and awards received by female and male scientists engaged in obesity research worldwide. Median citations were compared by sex and year, with group differences assessed using the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test.


Results
Our findings reveal a concerning difference: In most representative countries, a higher proportion of male principal investigators received grant support, with Japan exhibiting the most pronounced gender bias. In highly cited obesity papers, female corresponding authors constituted only 33%, with Japan having the lowest representation at a mere 5%, whereas the Netherlands approached near‐equal representation (49%). Furthermore, highly cited obesity papers authored by women generally received fewer citations than those by men across most analyzed years and countries. However, a positive trend emerged in awards: the European Association for the Study of Obesity and the Association for the Study of Obesity recognized female scientists at a higher rate than male scientists.


Conclusions
These findings highlight a complex landscape. Although female scientists have gained increased support and recognition in several countries, significant gender inequality persists in obesity research.

Median citations were compared by sex and year, with group differences assessed using the nonparametric Mann–Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings reveal a concerning difference: In most representative countries, a higher proportion of male principal investigators received grant support, with Japan exhibiting the most pronounced gender bias. In highly cited obesity papers, female corresponding authors constituted only 33%, with Japan having the lowest representation at a mere 5%, whereas the Netherlands approached near-equal representation (49%). Furthermore, highly cited obesity papers authored by women generally received fewer citations than those by men across most analyzed years and countries. However, a positive trend emerged in awards: the European Association for the Study of Obesity and the Association for the Study of Obesity recognized female scientists at a higher rate than male scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight a complex landscape. Although female scientists have gained increased support and recognition in several countries, significant gender inequality persists in obesity research.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Grip strength: are some adiposity phenotypes more detrimental than others? A Mendelian randomization study</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
Our objective was to investigate causal associations of adiposity in different locations and metabolically favorable and unfavorable adiposity (MetFA and MetUFA, respectively) with grip strength.


Methods
Observational cross‐sectional and Mendelian randomization (MR) (sex combined and stratified) analysis within UK Biobank (N ≤ 340,258) was used to assess the relationships of  visceral, abdominal subcutaneous, and gluteofemoral adipose tissue, anterior and posterior thigh muscle fat infiltration (ATMFI and PTMFI, respectively), body fat (BF) percentage, MetFA, and MetUFA with grip strength.


Results
In inverse variance weighted MR analysis, SD increases in BF, MetFA, and ATMFI were associated with lower grip strength by the following: −0.10 SD (95% CI: −0.16 to −0.04), −0.31 SD (95% CI: −0.45 to −0.18), and −0.05 SD (95% CI: −0.09 to −0.01), respectively. PTMFI associations aligned with ATMFI. Observational analyses were consistent for BF and ATMFI/PTMFI, but weighted median/mode MR corroborated findings for MetFA and ATMFI/PTMFI only. Higher visceral adipose tissue was associated with lower grip strength in observational analyses only. Associations for higher abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue were inconsistent: Observational analyses suggested weaker grip; MR analyses suggested stronger grip, particularly in female individuals. There was no strong evidence in MR for associations with MetUFA or gluteofemoral adipose tissue.


Conclusions
Targeting fat infiltration in muscle may improve muscle function. MetFA appears to negatively impact muscle strength, requiring further investigation into underlying mechanisms.

Abstract

Objective
This study aimed to determine trends in the prevalence of health factors and risk factors based on Life's Essential 8 (LE8) among US adults.


Methods
The present study included 26,548 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2007–2008 to 2017–2020. Crude weighted prevalence and 95% CI values of individual risk and health factors based on LE8 were estimated by cycle, and their trends were assessed in logistic regression models.


Results
From 2007–2008 to 2017–2020, the prevalence of lack of physical activity (27.2% to 22.5%), current smoking (21.2% to 15.9%), less sleep time (37.1% to 22.7%), and hyperlipidemia (55.8% to 50.8%) decreased, and obesity (33.9% to 43.3%) and hypertension (31.5% to 34.6%) increased, whereas unhealthy diet and diabetes remained stable. There were significant increases in the prevalence of sufficient physical activity (59.7% to 66.7%), never smoking (50.3% to 55.5%), enough sleep time (56.8% to 60.6%), and normal blood lipids (30.2% to 35.6%) and significant decreases in the prevalence of normal weight (30.8% to 25.7%), normal blood glucose (71.5% to 64.8%), and normal blood pressure (61.3% to 58.7%).


Conclusions
This study found improvement in physical activity, smoking, sleep health, and blood lipids and worsening of weight, blood glucose, and blood pressure among US adults from 2007–2008 to 2017–2020.

         <title>Benefits of Krill Oil Supplementation During Alternate‐Day Fasting in Adults With Overweight and Obesity: A Randomized Trial</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT

Objective
To investigate the effect of krill oil (KO) supplementation during alternate‐day fasting (ADF) on body composition and muscle function in healthy adults with overweight.


Methods
In a randomized trial, during the 8‐week ADF, participants consumed four capsules per day containing krill oil (KO group) or vegetable oil (placebo group). Each capsule of KO contained 191 mg EPA, 94 mg DHA, 78 mg choline, and 100 mcg astaxanthin. Body mass, fat‐free mass (FFM), and handgrip strength (HGS) were measured before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed using ANOVA.


Results
The study was completed by 41 (25 women and 16 men) participants (age: 39 ± 10 years, BMI: 31.1 ± 4.2 kg/m2). Body weight reduction was not different (p &gt; 0.05) between groups (KO, −4.6 ± 1.4 kg; Placebo, −4.5 ± 1.9 kg). The KO group had no change (p &gt; 0.05) in FFM (−0.2 ± 0.9 kg) or HGS (−0.2 ± 0.5 kg). The placebo group experienced a reduction (p &lt; 0.05) in FFM (−1.2 ± 2.0 kg) and HGS (−0.9 ± 0.7 kg). Changes in FFM and HGS were different (p &lt; 0.05) between groups.


Conclusions
KO supplementation during body weight loss attenuates the decline in FFM and muscle strength.

         <title>Synergistic association of estradiol and body roundness index with accelerated biological aging in male individuals</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship of estradiol or body roundness index (BRI), respectively, or the coexistence of their changes with accelerated biological aging in male individuals.


Methods
A cross‐sectional study with 1818 male individuals aged 20 to 79 years who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2015‐2016 was conducted, in which positive phenotypic age acceleration value was defined as the occurrence of accelerated biological aging. Weighted multivariate logistic regression models were established to evaluate the independent and joint associations of estradiol and BRI with male accelerated biological aging. Restricted cubic spline models were used to explore whether a nonlinear relationship existed.


Results
An independent association of either serum estradiol or BRI with male accelerated biological aging was significantly shown after adjusting for important covariates. For BRI, such an association was nonlinear, but estradiol did not exhibit a similar nonlinear correlation. Moreover, the coexistence of a high level of serum estradiol and a high level of BRI obviously strengthens such an association in adjusted models, suggesting the cooperative impact of estradiol with BRI.


Conclusions
Both serum estradiol and BRI are significantly associated with accelerated biological aging in male individuals. Integrating high estradiol with high BRI might noticeably reinforce this association.

         <title>Associations of BMI, sleep quality, and sleep duration trajectories with new‐onset diabetes mellitus in the elderly</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
Our objective was to investigate the relationships between BMI, sleep quality, and sleep duration trajectories and new‐onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) in the elderly.


Methods
We analyzed 2648 diabetes‐free participants aged ≥60 years from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) in 2014. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we examined the associations of BMI, self‐reported sleep quality, and sleep duration trajectories (categorized as persistent short, persistent normal, persistent long, low‐increasing, normal‐decreasing, normal‐increasing, and long‐decreasing) with NODM risk over 4 years. Diabetes diagnosis was self‐reported.


Results
Over 4 years, 94 participants developed NODM. Obesity was associated with the highest risk (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.247 [CI: 1.212–4.168]). Compared with individuals with good sleep quality, those with poor sleep quality showed an increased risk of NODM, but this association was not statistically significant (HR 1.570 [0.903–2.731]). Additionally, persistent short, normal‐decreasing, and long‐decreasing sleep trajectories were associated with elevated NODM risk (adjusted HR values 11.662 [CI: 1.565–86.896], 8.403 [CI: 1.023–69.010], and 9.474 [CI: 1.269–70.700]).


Conclusions
BMI, sleep quality, and sleep duration trajectories are associated with NODM risk. Individuals with higher BMI values, poor sleep quality, or persistent short or decreasing sleep duration may be at higher risk for NODM, warranting further attention.

Compared with individuals with good sleep quality, those with poor sleep quality showed an increased risk of NODM, but this association was not statistically significant (HR 1.570 [0.903–2.731]). Additionally, persistent short, normal-decreasing, and long-decreasing sleep trajectories were associated with elevated NODM risk (adjusted HR values 11.662 [CI: 1.565–86.896], 8.403 [CI: 1.023–69.010], and 9.474 [CI: 1.269–70.700]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMI, sleep quality, and sleep duration trajectories are associated with NODM risk. Individuals with higher BMI values, poor sleep quality, or persistent short or decreasing sleep duration may be at higher risk for NODM, warranting further attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Prevalence of Clinical Obesity in US Adults, 2017–2020</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT

Objective
We aimed to estimate the prevalence of clinical obesity among US adults using the newly proposed definition and evaluate differences across demographic subgroups.


Methods
This cross‐sectional study analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017–2020 cycle. The analysis included 8037 adults aged 20 years or older with complete data. Clinical obesity was defined per the Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology Commission on the definition and diagnosis of clinical obesity.


Results
Among 8037 participants, the overall prevalence of clinical obesity was 9.7% (95% CI, 8.9%–10.5%), with comparable prevalence in males (9.8%) and in females (9.6%). Younger adults (aged 20–39 years) exhibited the highest prevalence (11.9%), followed by those aged 40–59 years (8.2%). Significant racial/ethnic and sex disparities were observed, with Mexican females having the highest prevalence (13.9%), followed by non‐Hispanic Black females (13.5%) and non‐Hispanic White males (10.6%). The prevalence decreased significantly when the new definition with organ dysfunctions or limitations of daily activities was applied compared with BMI alone.


Conclusions
This study provided the first nationally representative estimates of clinical obesity prevalence in US adults based on the new definition.

         <title>Adiposity associations with risk of colorectal cancer: a systematic review</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studies examining colorectal cancer (CRC) associations with adiposity are limited compared to anthropometric studies. Current evidence suggests increased CRC risk with greater adipose, though some studies did not reach significance. This systematic review also underscores the need for standardization of measures to better elucidate CRC and adiposity associations.







Abstract

Objective
This systematic review evaluates the relationship between adiposity and incident colorectal cancer (CRC) risk.


Methods
MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL were searched for articles that met the following criteria: 1) assessed adiposity measures; 2) included incident data for any diagnosed malignant stage of CRC, colon cancer, or rectal cancer; and 3) studied adults aged older than 18 years. Articles were assessed for bias using the National Institutes of Health study quality assessment tools.


Results
Fifteen articles across ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Three significant associations were positive, one was negative, and eleven were nonsignificant and positive. Measures varied based on the tool, and these four tools were used to gather body composition measures: bioelectrical impedance, computerized tomography, dual‐energy x‐ray absorptiometry, and ultrasound. The most used were total body fat mass and percent fat, along with abdominal visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues. Overall, higher levels of adipose were positively associated with an increased risk of CRC. The strength of associations and significance varied by body composition variable, measurement technique, tumor location, and sex.


Conclusions
Standardization is needed to better elucidate the relation between CRC and adiposity to allow for comparisons across papers. Additionally, a balance among precision, accessibility, and cost of measurements must be struck.

         <title>Associations between coexposure to bisphenols mixture and metabolic diseases: based on three statistical models</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Introduction
Bisphenol A (BPA) and its substitutes are common environmental endocrine disruptors. We investigated whether coexposure to BPA and its substitutes are associated with metabolic diseases (MDs), the related indicators, and their multimorbidity.


Methods
The study included 1409 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Generalized linear regression, Bayesian kernel machine regression, and the weighted quantile sum (WQS) models were used to study the associations between bisphenol concentrations and comprehensive MDs, including their multimorbidity.


Results
In the logistic regression model, BPA and bisphenol F were each independently associated with obesity, whereas BPA and bisphenol S (BPS) were each independently associated with multimorbidity. In the Bayesian kernel machine regression analysis, the joint effects of the three chemicals were positively associated with hypertension and obesity, with BPS generating the highest posterior inclusion probability. In the WQS regression analysis, the WQS index demonstrated significant associations with obesity and hypertension, with BPS the highest contributor to both of them.


Conclusions
Three statistical methods confirmed that BPA and its substitutes were associated with specific MDs. Our findings indicate that coexposure to bisphenols significantly increases the risk of obesity and hypertension.

         <title>Prepregnancy GLP‐1RA use improves maternal lipid metabolism via liver‐secreted FGF21 during pregnancy in HFD‐fed dams</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
Obesity in women of childbearing age disrupts lipid metabolism in pregnancy. This study aims to evaluate the impact of prepregnancy glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1RA) use on lipid metabolism during pregnancy.


Methods
A retrospective case–control study with 42 participants was employed to analyze the impact of prepregnancy GLP‐1RA use on lipid metabolism during pregnancy in women with obesity. An animal study involved 60 virgin female Sprague Dawley rats fed a normal diet or a high‐fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks, with the latter diet divided into HFD + saline, HFD + liraglutide, and HFD + semaglutide for 4 weeks. Rats were mated and then sacrificed on gestational day 21.


Results
Clinically, prepregnancy GLP‐1RA use reduced prepregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain, ratio with first‐trimester metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease, and triglyceride levels during pregnancy. In animals, GLP‐1RA improved plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), adiponectin, triglyceride levels, and leptin in midgestation. During late gestation, compared with the HFD group, the GLP‐1RA groups exhibited improved liver lipid deposition, increased fatty acid oxidation and lipolysis genes, decreased lipogenesis genes, and increased extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK)/peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor γ (PPAR‐γ) and AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK)/NAD‐dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin‐1 (SIRT1) pathways in liver; in the visceral adipose, the GLP‐1RA groups showed increased lipolysis genes, decreased lipogenesis genes, and increased phosphorylated to total fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) with activated ERK/PPAR‐γ pathways.


Conclusions
Prepregnancy GLP‐1RA use improves maternal lipid metabolism during pregnancy, potentially involving elevated liver‐secreted FGF21. This study offers a new strategy for treating lipid metabolic disorders in pregnancy.

         <title>Secondary analysis of the Game of Stones trial for men with obesity: examining moderator effects and exploratory outcomes</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
The objective was to explore whether socioeconomic, health, and behavioral characteristics moderate the effectiveness of a text message intervention with or without financial incentives versus a control group and to examine differences in exploratory outcomes.


Methods
This three‐group randomized trial including 585 men with obesity compared daily automated behavioral text messages alongside financial incentives, text messages alone, and a waiting list control for 12 months. Moderator analyses examined percentage weight change after 12 months for 9 socioeconomic and 11 health factors. Exploratory outcomes included the following: self‐reported physical activity, sedentary behavior, smoking and alcohol behaviors, engagement in 15 weight‐management strategies, and weight‐management–related confidence.


Results
No moderator effects were found by any factors for either comparison versus control. There were no differences across groups for health behaviors. The texts with incentives group had higher levels of engagement in six strategies including weight goals, food changes, and self‐weighing and higher levels of confidence compared with the control.


Conclusions
The Game of Stones interventions were equally effective across various subgroups based on socioeconomic, health, or well‐being status. Texts with financial incentives group participants showed better engagement for some intervention elements. The implementation of Game of Stones is unlikely to increase health inequalities. Future studies should focus on increasing engagement.

         <title>The mLIFE randomized trial examining the impact of gamifying social support provision for weight loss</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adults with overweight or obesity (n = 243) were randomized to the mLIFE + points (points for social support activities) or mLIFE group (no points). mLIFE + points participants lost 5.3 ± 0.6 kg at 12 months (vs. 3.5 ± 0.7 kg mLIFE; p = 0.09). Among adherent participants (n = 127), mLIFE + points participants lost more weight (7.3 ± 0.8 kg) than mLIFE (3.8 ± 0.9 kg; p &lt; 0.01).







Abstract

Objective
The Mobile Lifestyle Intervention for Food and Exercise (mLIFE) study was a 12‐month mobile weight loss intervention examining social gaming to promote social support.


Methods
Adults with overweight or obesity (n = 243) were randomized to the mLIFE + points (received points for social support activities) or mLIFE group (blinded to points). Weight was measured via Fitbit scales. Repeated‐measures mixed models were used to conduct both an intent‐to‐treat analysis and an analysis among adherent participants (logged on to the mLIFE app ≥25% of study days).


Results
Attrition was lower in the mLIFE + points group (22% vs. 41% in mLIFE; χ2 = 9.8, p &lt; 0.01), and adherence was higher (61% vs. 42% in mLIFE; χ2 = 7.6, p &lt; 0.01). None of the group × time interactions was significant for the intent‐to‐treat analysis except for total number of points earned at 12 months (mLIFE + points mean 605.9 [SE 203.2] vs. mLIFE mean 350.0 [SE 200.0]; p &lt; 0.01). The mLIFE + points participants lost a mean of 5.3 [SE 0.6] kg at 12 months (vs. mean 3.5 [SE 0.7] kg in mLIFE; p = 0.09). Among adherent participants (n = 127), mLIFE + points participants lost more weight (mean 7.3 [SE 0.8] kg) than mLIFE (mean 3.8 [SE 0.9] kg; p &lt; 0.01).


Conclusions
The use of points led to greater weight loss at 12 months, but only among adherent participants. Providing points for completing social support activities is a way to retain participants and increase engagement in a mobile intervention.

         <title>Long‐acting PYY3−36 analogue with semaglutide for obesity: from preclinical assessment through randomized clinical studies</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
The hormone peptide YY (PYY; cleaved into Y2‐selective form PYY3‐36) is an attractive candidate for use as a complementary pharmacotherapy for obesity along with glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists. This series of studies investigated a novel long‐acting PYY3‐36 analogue (PYY1875) alone and as an add‐on to semaglutide for treatment of obesity.


Methods
Weight loss and food intake were first investigated in obese male rats, followed by phase 1 and 2 clinical studies investigating efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of PYY1875 as monotherapy and in combination with semaglutide in participants with overweight or obesity.


Results
PYY1875 induced additional body weight loss in semaglutide‐treated obese rats. In the phase 1 study, all doses of PYY1875 alone and coadministered with semaglutide were tolerated. In the phase 2 study, a modest but not clinically meaningful treatment effect of PYY1875 1.0 mg versus placebo as an add‐on to semaglutide 2.4 mg was observed. However, gastrointestinal‐related adverse events were common with the 1.0‐mg PYY1875 dose, and the 2.0‐mg PYY1875 dose escalation regimen was not tolerated (both as add‐ons to semaglutide).


Conclusions
PYY1875 showed modest efficacy as an add‐on to semaglutide for weight management in people with obesity, but the treatment was not well tolerated.

         <title>A geriatrician's approach to managing the complex older adult with obesity</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The prevalence of obesity in older adults is rapidly increasing due to the demographic shift occurring globally. Older adults with obesity face health care challenges due to multimorbidity, functional dependency, and disability. This population often has prior history of struggles through weight‐loss attempts during the middle years of life. Therefore, weight‐loss intervention needs a personalized approach, taking into consideration weight‐loss attempts, relapse, and life events, including bariatric surgery, functional limitations, psychosocial status, and current residential environment. Racial and ethnic and systemic disparities based on gender, sexual orientation, rurality, zip code, and income merit attention, as they are barriers to obesity management. Intensive lifestyle intervention with dietary changes and physical activity remains the cornerstone of obesity management, with pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery as adjuncts in the armamentarium. With the revolutionary influx of antiobesity medications, geriatricians face the challenge to treat obesity with limited evidence‐based interventions in older adults. The goal of this review is to guide geriatricians with current evidence of obesity management in older adults. This review highlights the need for a tailored weight‐management approach to be delivered to this fast‐growing segment of the population with complex needs, which is predicted to impact health care economics due to the related comorbidities and disabilities.

         <title>Variability in body weight and body composition and cognitive trajectories in older adults in the United States</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
This study examined the associations of variability and patterns in BMI, body weight (BW), and waist circumference (WC) with cognitive decline.


Methods
A total of 4304 participants (aged ≥65 years) from the National Health and Aging Trends Study between 2011 around 2021 were analyzed. Adjusted mixed‐effect models assessed BW and body composition variability metrics linked to cognitive function z scores over 11 years, including standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), root mean square error, last‐to‐first assessment change groups, and overall pattern over the follow‐up.


Results
Participants in the highest SD variability quartile had the fastest cognitive decline (β = −0.036 [95% CI: −0.044 to −0.028] z scores per year) compared with the lowest variability BMI quartile (β = −0.019 [95% CI: −0.027 to −0.010] z scores per year, p values for interaction, &lt; 0.001). Similar trends were observed for BMI CV and root mean square error, BW SD and CV, and WC CV. Compared with the stable or gain group, participants with ≥5% loss in BMI and BW had the fastest cognitive decline (both p values for interaction, &lt; 0.0002). The cognitive decline rates among the stable, loss, gain and cycling patterns in BMI, BW, or WC were not significantly different.


Conclusions
Greater variability and loss in BW and body composition were linked to accelerated cognitive decline in older adults.

         <title>Beyond weight loss: exploring bile acid modulations after bariatric surgery and their impact on type 2 diabetes across 5 years</title>
         <description>Obesity, Volume 33, Issue 7, Page 1275-1286, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract

Objective
This study aimed to explore the dynamic role of bile acids (BAs) in metabolic improvements following bariatric surgery, specifically comparing the effects of silastic ring laparoscopic Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass (SR‐LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on BA composition and clinical parameters over a 5‐year period.


Methods
A cohort of patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes underwent SR‐LRYGB or LSG. Principal component analysis was performed to evaluate BAs and clinical outcomes.


Results
Despite significant increases in the first year after surgery, BA levels returned to baseline after 5 years. However, principal component analysis revealed that certain BA profiles may contribute to long‐term metabolic benefits.


Conclusions
Although total BA levels return to baseline by 5 years after surgery, specific BA profiles, as identified by principal component analysis from oral glucose tolerance test data, are associated with sustained metabolic improvements. SR‐LRYGB is associated with more durable metabolic benefits compared with LSG. However, given the use of the oral glucose tolerance test, which may not fully capture postprandial BA dynamics, further research using mixed‐meal tolerance tests is needed to confirm these findings.

Abstract

Objective
We aimed to understand data‐driven dietary patterns in Canadian preschoolers and their impact on obesity development among male and female individuals.


Methods
In the prospective, population‐based Canadian pregnancy cohort, the CHILD Cohort Study (N = 2219), dietary intake was assessed at age 3 years using a previously developed 112‐item food frequency questionnaire. At age 5 years, we measured height, weight, and waist circumference and calculated BMI and waist circumference z scores. Obesity was defined as BMI z score &gt; 2. We used principal components analysis to derive dietary patterns and multivariable‐adjusted regression analyses to determine dietary patterns' associations with BMI and waist circumference z scores, as well as obesity status.


Results
Among Canadian preschoolers, we identified three dietary patterns: “Prudent” (high in vegetables, fruits, legumes, and fish); “Western‐like” (high in fast foods, red/processed meats, and carbonated drinks); and “Refined Grain‐Snack” (high in refined grains, dairy, and salty snacks). At age 5 years, 4.7% of the children were living with obesity (3.1% male individuals and 1.6% female individuals). Females adhering to the Refined Grain‐Snack pattern had higher waist circumference z scores (β = 0.14; 95% CI: 0.03–0.25) and 2.74‐fold odds of living with obesity (95% CI: 1.29–5.85). No significant associations were observed among male individuals or with other dietary patterns and obesity outcomes among female individuals.


Conclusions
Preschool dietary patterns are associated with sex‐biased obesity development, highlighting the need for further research to explore these differences and inform targeted obesity prevention strategies during this important developmental period.

         <title>Food insecurity and the risk of diabetes: understanding the role of BMI as a mediator and moderator</title>

Abstract

Objective
This retrospective cohort study examined BMI as a mediator and moderator of the association between food insecurity and diabetes.


Methods
Data came from the electronic health records of 74,174 primary care patients at a large academic medical center. We used multivariate Poisson regression models to examine the association between food insecurity and diabetes. We used causal mediation analysis to evaluate the direct and indirect effects by which BMI mediates and moderates this association and the extent to which these effects varied by age, sex, and race and ethnicity.


Results
During the 5‐year period, 6.2% of patients were newly diagnosed with diabetes. Food insecurity was associated with a higher risk of diabetes (relative risk [RR] 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03–1.36) after multivariate adjustment. In mediation analysis, BMI was a significant mediator of the association between food insecurity and diabetes (natural indirect effect: RR 1.10, 95% CI: 1.06–1.14). When accounting for an interaction with BMI, BMI remained a significant mediator (natural indirect effect: RR 1.12, 95% CI: 1.0–1.17). In subgroup analyses, the mediator–moderator effect of BMI was stronger among adults &lt;45 years old and female patients; there were no differences by race or ethnicity.


Conclusions
Our findings support BMI as a mediator and moderator of the association between food insecurity and diabetes.

         <title>Development and validation of an eating behavior patient‐reported outcome measure in people living with obesity or overweight</title>

Abstract

Objective
The objective of this study was to develop a measure of eating behaviors in adults living with obesity or overweight.


Methods
Based on concept‐elicitation (n = 53) and cognitive‐debriefing (n = 15) studies, a draft eating behavior patient‐reported outcome (EB PRO) measure was developed. Its psychometric properties were established using data from a 46‐week clinical trial of an investigational antiobesity medication (n = 387).


Results
The final EB PRO comprised 12 items across two domains (i.e., “Desire to Eat” and “Capacity to Resist”; 6 items each) and a Total Eating Behavior score (0–48; higher scores worse). The EB PRO demonstrated good test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients &gt; 0.7). Confirmatory factor analysis showed a comparative fit index of 0.98 with good internal consistency (Cronbach α &gt; 0.7). The EB PRO generally exhibited moderate‐to‐large correlations with the Patient Global Impression of Severity questionnaire and Three‐Factor Eating Questionnaire and weaker correlation with the 36‐Item Short‐Form Health Survey version 2 Physical Functioning scale. All EB PRO scores improved from baseline to week 46 (p &lt; 0.0001), demonstrating sensitivity to change with therapy. Clinically meaningful thresholds were defined as eight‐ and four‐point changes in Total Eating Behavior and domain scores, respectively.


Conclusions
The EB PRO measure is a promising tool for assessing eating behaviors in people with obesity or overweight.

         <title>Spatial–temporal analysis and spatial drivers of childhood obesity in China from 1985 to 2019</title>

Abstract

Objective
We characterized the spatial–temporal trends of obesity among Chinese children and adolescents from 1985 to 2019 and examined the impact of social determinants of health (SDOH) patterns.


Methods
Using data from the Chinese National Survey on Students' Constitution and Health (CNSSCH) conducted between 1985 and 2019, featuring seven cross‐sectional surveys, we employed spatial–temporal analysis methods and collected 23 obesity‐related variables to identify SDOH patterns. A general linear regression model investigated associations between SDOH patterns and obesity prevalence.


Results
Obesity prevalence rose from 0.1% to 8.1%. Northern regions formed a high‐obesity cluster, whereas Southern regions were low‐obesity clusters. The following four SDOH patterns emerged: Western Resource‐Limited Frontier, Coastal‐Central Development Belt, Inland Agricultural Heartland, and Metropolitan Resource‐Rich Hubs. Prevalence was 5.7%, 5.8%, 10.2%, and 11.3% for Patterns 1 through 4, respectively. Compared with Pattern 2, Patterns 3 and 4 showed higher obesity risks.


Conclusions
Childhood obesity prevalence in China increased with regional disparities from 1985 to 2019, with higher prevalence in the North and lower prevalence in the South. SDOH patterns were linked to spatial clusters, suggesting that regions characterized by advanced urbanization, abundant resources (Pattern 4), and a dietary profile heavy in carbohydrates and low in protein (Pattern 3) potentially contributed to increased obesity risk.

         <title>Generational differences in associations between health conditions in young women and BMI categories</title>
         <description>Obesity, Volume 33, Issue 7, Page 1386-1394, July 2025. </description>

Abstract

Objective
The objective of this study was to investigate whether the associations between BMI categories and the age‐specific prevalence of health conditions common in young women differed across generations.


Methods
Data were from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health for participants born between 1973 and 1978 or 1989 and 1995 and recruited in 1996 and 2013, respectively. Women were included if they reported their weight and height at waves conducted when they were aged 18 to 23, 22 to 27, and 25 to 30 years. Outcomes were self‐rated health, the prevalence of common conditions, menstrual symptoms, and pregnancy complications. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations to account for repeated measures.


Results
For fair or poor self‐rated health, the ORs were higher for women in the underweight range (OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.30–1.74) or the overweight range (OR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.34–1.60), were highest for women with obesity (OR 3.04, 95% CI: 2.76–3.35) compared with women with normal weight, and were higher for the more recent cohort (OR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.38–1.63). This same pattern was apparent for all outcomes.


Conclusions
The health impacts of increasing BMI are not lessened in more recent generations. This evidence can be used to promote the benefits of normal BMI for young women.

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to investigate whether the associations between BMI categories and the age-specific prevalence of health conditions common in young women differed across generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data were from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health for participants born between 1973 and 1978 or 1989 and 1995 and recruited in 1996 and 2013, respectively. Women were included if they reported their weight and height at waves conducted when they were aged 18 to 23, 22 to 27, and 25 to 30 years. Outcomes were self-rated health, the prevalence of common conditions, menstrual symptoms, and pregnancy complications. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations to account for repeated measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fair or poor self-rated health, the ORs were higher for women in the underweight range (OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.30–1.74) or the overweight range (OR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.34–1.60), were highest for women with obesity (OR 3.04, 95% CI: 2.76–3.35) compared with women with normal weight, and were higher for the more recent cohort (OR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.38–1.63). This same pattern was apparent for all outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health impacts of increasing BMI are not lessened in more recent generations. This evidence can be used to promote the benefits of normal BMI for young women.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The NLRP3 inhibitor NT‐0796 enhances and sustains GLP‐1R agonist‐mediated weight loss in a murine diet‐induced obesity model</title>
         <description>Obesity, Volume 33, Issue 7, Page 1309-1321, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In mouse diet‐induced obesity models, the brain penetrant NLRP3 inhibitor NT‐0796 enhances and sustains the efficacy of the GLP‐1RA semaglutide, leading to a complete reversal of obesity. This correlates with reduced peripheral inflammation and anti‐neuroinflammatory activities, including a reduction in hypothalamic gliosis suggesting further benefits from a NT‐0796/semaglutide combination.







Abstract

Objective
In order to investigate whether a central nervous system penetrant anti‐inflammatory could augment or sustain obesity treatment with semaglutide (Wegovy), a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor (GLP‐1R) agonist, we tested two hypotheses in models of diet‐induced obesity (DIO): 1) a centrally penetrant NLPR3 inhibitor, NT‐0796, drives enhanced weight loss when combined with low‐dose semaglutide, compared to monotherapy; and 2) NT‐0796 monotherapy sustains weight loss induced by semaglutide.


Methods
Mice fed a standard high‐fat or a polyunsaturated fatty acid diet served as models of DIO and were dosed with low‐dose semaglutide, NT‐0796, or combinations. Body weight, food intake, peripheral inflammatory markers, and hypothalamic glial fibrillary acidic protein expression were assessed.


Results
Combined dosing of NT‐0796 with semaglutide drove greater weight loss than either monotherapy alone, and this effect was enhanced in mice consuming the polyunsaturated fatty acid diet. In addition, NT‐0796 sharply limited weight regain following cessation of semaglutide therapy and normalized markers of both peripheral inflammation and hypothalamic astrogliosis to a far greater extent than either semaglutide or calorie restriction.


Conclusions
Alleviation of obesity‐associated inflammation via NLRP3 inhibition 1) constitutes an effective weight‐loss strategy as monotherapy in mice with DIO, 2) augments the weight‐loss efficacy of a subtherapeutic dose of semaglutide, and 3) blocks recovery of lost weight following cessation of semaglutide.

         <title>Association of tirzepatide with cardiometabolic benefits in Chinese adults: post hoc subgroup analysis of SURMOUNT‐CN study</title>
         <description>Obesity, Volume 33, Issue 7, Page 1287-1296, July 2025. </description>

Abstract

Objective
The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of tirzepatide with body weight, cardiometabolic markers, and metabolic syndrome in Chinese participants achieving normal body mass index (BMI) values by week 52 across baseline BMI subgroups.


Methods
This post hoc analysis of SURMOUNT‐CN assessed the association of tirzepatide with cardiometabolic risk factors in Chinese participants, categorized by Chinese‐specific anthropometric cutoffs for BMI and waist circumference. The association of early weight loss (greater or less than median at 12 and 24 weeks) with cardiometabolic markers and metabolic syndrome was evaluated.


Results
In this post hoc analysis (N = 177; tirzepatide 10 mg, n = 62; tirzepatide 15 mg, n = 57; placebo, n = 58), participants with greater weight reduction (greater than or equal to the median percentage loss at 12 and 24 weeks) showed significantly greater improvements in cardiometabolic markers. Tirzepatide also significantly reduced body weight, BMI, and waist circumference compared with placebo (p &lt; 0.05). At week 52, 37 participants achieved a normal BMI (18.5–24 kg/m2, Chinese criteria), and metabolic syndrome dropped from 21.6% at baseline to 0%.


Conclusions
Early weight loss with tirzepatide was associated with significant improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, particularly in Chinese adults achieving a normal BMI by week 52, suggesting that early response may be associated with enhanced long‐term metabolic health outcomes.

         <title>Exercise and diet effects on delay discounting and related neurobiology in adults with overweight or obesity: A randomized trial</title>
         <description>Obesity, Volume 33, Issue 7, Page 1263-1274, July 2025. </description>

Abstract

Objective
This study compared effects of exercise training and diet on impulsivity‐related behaviors as measured by delay discounting and related neurobiology in adults with overweight or obesity. We hypothesized that exercise versus diet would be associated with reduced delay discounting propensity (k) and increased response in brain regions involved in cognitive control (medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral anterior insulae).


Methods
Participants (N = 40) were randomized to 12 weeks of exercise training or diet intervention. At baseline and postintervention, they completed a delay discounting task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in fasted and fed (post‐meal) conditions. Linear mixed effects models assessed fasted–fed intervention effects on k and brain response in regions of interest. Exploratory analyses assessed whole‐brain, satiety‐state–specific, and reaction time effects.


Results
Across groups, k and reaction time during delay discounting decreased and weight decreased from baseline to postintervention (p values ≤ 0.010). In exploratory fed‐state whole‐brain analyses, a group × session effect was observed in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p &lt; 0.005), driven by exercise‐associated changes. A similar group × session interaction effect was observed in the anterior cingulate cortex (p = 0.006), also driven by reductions in fed‐state response.


Conclusions
Both interventions altered delay discounting behaviors. Exercise training was associated with reduced fed‐state engagement of brain regions involved in self‐referential processing and regulation during decision‐making.

         <title>Modeling potential cost‐effectiveness of tirzepatide versus lifestyle modification for patients with overweight and obesity</title>
         <description>Obesity, Volume 33, Issue 7, Page 1297-1308, July 2025. </description>

Abstract

Objective
Our objective was to model the potential cost‐effectiveness of tirzepatide as an alternative to lifestyle modification (LSM) for the management of obesity and overweight.


Methods
An individual‐level discrete event simulation was implemented in Microsoft Excel linking short‐term outcomes from the SURMOUNT‐1 trial to key obesity‐related complications to estimate costs and health benefits of tirzepatide (5‐mg, 10‐mg, or 15‐mg doses) and LSM over a lifetime time horizon. Treatment‐related changes in cardiometabolic factors were modeled using data from SURMOUNT‐1; the relationship between patient status and risk of obesity complications was obtained from published literature. Modeled complications included cardiovascular events, onset of type 2 diabetes, cancer, osteoarthritis, and sleep apnea. The model simulated 1000 adult patients with overweight or obesity over their lifetimes, applying a 3% annual discount rate to cost and health outcomes. Only direct medical costs were considered.


Results
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg provided 0.54, 0.55, and 0.61 additional quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) and additional costs of $79,288, $70,453, and $75,839 versus LSM, yielding incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios of $146,331, $127,644, and $125,053 per QALY gained, respectively.


Conclusions
The model predicted that all doses of tirzepatide represent cost‐effective alternatives to LSM for management of overweight and obesity at a willingness‐to‐pay threshold of $150,000 per QALY.

Abstract

Objective
We explored the impact of food insecurity on three different measures of obesity, that is, estimated percentage body fat (PBF), BMI, and waist circumference (WC), and examined the presence of sociodemographic disparities.


Methods
This cross‐sectional study used data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2019–2021 (n = 12,447, aged ≥30 years). Food insecurity was evaluated using an 18‐item modified version of the US Household Food Security Survey Module. Three obesity measures were defined: PBF ≥25% for men or ≥35% for women, BMI ≥25 kg/m2, and WC ≥90 cm for men or ≥85 cm for women. Logistic regression models were employed to estimate odds ratio (OR) values with 95% CI.


Results
Of those measured, 4% of households experienced food insecurity (men 3.7%, women 4.6%). In women, food insecurity was positively associated with PBF‐defined obesity (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.03–1.81) but not with BMI‐ or WC‐defined obesity. When analyzed by sociodemographic factors, positive associations between food insecurity and PBF‐defined obesity were observed in older women and urban residents but not in their counterparts.


Conclusions
Food insecurity seems to have a stronger positive association with PBF than with BMI or WC among Korean women, especially those who are older and reside in urban areas.

         <title>Metabolic clearance rate of insulin across the glucose tolerance spectrum by race and ethnicity in youth with obesity</title>
         <description>Obesity, Volume 33, Issue 7, Page 1365-1374, July 2025. </description>

Abstract

Objective
Despite β‐cell failure in youth with dysglycemia (i.e., impaired glucose tolerance [IGT] and type 2 diabetes), fasting insulin (FI) concentrations are elevated. Herein, we examined the following: 1) metabolic clearance rate of insulin (MCRI) in youth with obesity and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) versus those with IGT versus those with type 2 diabetes; 2) racial and ethnic differences in insulin dynamics; and 3) metabolic/adiposity correlates of MCRI.


Methods
A total of 206 youth underwent assessment of fasting glucose, FI, MCRI and peripheral insulin sensitivity (PIS), first‐phase insulin secretion, disposition index, body composition, and abdominal adiposity.


Results
In type 2 diabetes versus NGT, MCRI was lower (p &lt; 0.001), and FI was higher (p &lt; 0.001). In Black versus White youth, MCRI was lower (p &lt; 0.001), driven by lower MCRI in youth with dysglycemia (p &lt; 0.001) and not with NGT. MCRI correlated inversely with FI, as well as adiposity measures, and correlated directly with PIS and disposition index. Lower PIS, lower MCRI, and higher first‐phase insulin secretion were characteristics of Black versus White youth with dysglycemia.


Conclusions
Higher FI concentrations in the presence of dysglycemia despite β‐cell failure could be explained by decreased MCRI. Racial and ethnic contrast in insulin dynamics differs by glycemic status and is more pronounced in dysglycemia manifested by lower MCRI and heightened first‐phase insulin secretion in Black versus White youth.

         <title>Does deciding not to participate in a lifestyle intervention for children with obesity affect the long‐term weight change?</title>
         <description>Obesity, Volume 33, Issue 7, Page 1334-1343, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
The objective of this study was to investigate whether long‐term weight change in children with obesity is affected after deciding not to participate in a lifestyle intervention.


Methods
This observational study included 713 children (aged 5–8 years) with obesity living in Aarhus, Denmark, of whom 157 decided not to participate in a community‐based lifestyle intervention between 2010 and 2020, and 556 were never invited to participate (i.e., no‐intervention group). Height and weight measurements were combined with socioeconomic information from national registers. A mixed‐effects model with splines was used to model changes in BMI z score and stratification to investigate effect modifications.


Results
We observed a median follow‐up of 3.6 years (quartile [Q]1;Q3: 0.4;5.1) for the decided‐not‐to‐participate group. No difference was observed in annual change in BMI z score between the decided‐not‐to‐participate and no‐intervention groups (0.00 per year, 95% CI: −0.03 to 0.03; p = 0.90). No effect modifications were observed between the two groups concerning highest completed household education (p = 0.59), household income (p = 0.72), or immigration status (p = 0.17).


Conclusions
Children deciding not to participate in an intervention did not increase their weight compared with children who were never invited, indicating that treatment could be briefly postponed until families are able to participate. Additionally, socioeconomic status or immigration background did not modify the weight change.

         <title>Dietary macronutrient content and energy intake in the mouse: hedonic or homeostatic override?</title>
         <description>Obesity, Volume 33, Issue 7, Page 1322-1333, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
The objective of this study was to reconcile how two landmark mouse studies came to opposite conclusions regarding the relationship between dietary macronutrient composition and energy intake. Hu et al. concluded that dietary fat drives excess energy intake because its hedonic properties override energy homeostasis. Solon‐Biet et al. concluded that energy intake increases with dietary fat owing to the dilution of protein and carbohydrates, with compensatory feeding for these nutrients dominating inhibitory feedback from fat.


Methods
Nutritional geometry was used to reanalyze data from Solon‐Biet et al. and Hu et al.


Results
Results from the two studies are strongly concordant. Neither was designed to measure hedonics but, in both studies, the positive associations among dietary fat, food, and energy intakes are as predicted by compensatory feeding for dietary protein and carbohydrates without the need to impute hedonic effects of fat.


Conclusions
Whereas conclusions cannot be drawn from either study regarding the role of hedonics, there is evidence for homeostatic feedback operating in both. We suggest that hedonic and homeostatic mechanisms likely interact, with homeostasis being more influential over the longer term. Therefore, “hedonic diversion” may be a more appropriate concept than “hedonic override” when considering energy consumption in mice and, perhaps, humans.

         <title>Improving the diagnosis of hyperphagia in melanocortin‐4 receptor pathway diseases</title>
         <description>Obesity, Volume 33, Issue 7, Page 1217-1231, July 2025. </description>

Abstract
Characteristics of hyperphagia include heightened and prolonged hunger, longer time to satiation, shorter duration of satiety, severe preoccupation with food (i.e., hyperphagic drive), abnormal food‐seeking behaviors, and distress or functional impairment when food is unavailable. Patients with melanocortin‐4 receptor (MC4R) pathway diseases including those caused by variants in one of multiple key genes of the pathway often present with hyperphagia that results in early‐onset, severe obesity because this pathway plays a critical role in regulation of hunger/satiation and energy balance. Patients with syndromic obesity (e.g., Bardet‐Biedl syndrome) may also have hyperphagia as a result of neurodevelopmental disruptions in the MC4R pathway. Genetic testing is suggested in patients with early‐onset, severe obesity and clinical features of genetic obesity (e.g., hyperphagia, neurodevelopmental differences, dysmorphic features); however, only a small percentage of individuals who meet these criteria undergo testing, potentially owing to limited availability, overlapping symptoms with other obesity types, and infrequent use of genetic testing during diagnosis. Diagnosing hyperphagia may be challenging, as no guidelines have been established for individuals with MC4R pathway diseases. Identifying these individuals is crucial to addressing the challenges of hyperphagia and associated obesity, which often limit quality of life and place overwhelming burdens on patients and families.

         <title>A GLP1R gene variant and sex influence the response to semaglutide treatment in patients with severe obesity</title>
         <description>Obesity, Volume 33, Issue 7, Page 1237-1242, July 2025. </description>

Abstract

Objective
The objective of this study is to identify whether the glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor (GLP1R) gene variant rs6923761G→A has an influence on semaglutide response in individuals with severe obesity.


Methods
From March 2023 to July 2024, we prospectively genotyped 112 patients treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly. All patients had been treated over 4 months for grade 3 obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2).


Results
The frequency of the rs6923761 AA variant was 9 out of 112 patients (8%), GA was 42 out of 112 (37.5%), and GG was 61 out of 112 (54.5%). The mean weight loss kinetics was 1.64% (SD 0.78%) per month in homozygotes of variant A in comparison with a mean weight loss of 1.04% (SD 0.79%) per month in carriers of at least one G variant (p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that rs6923761G→A and sex were independent predictors of weight loss. The rate of weight loss in women homozygous for the A allele was more than double that observed in men carrying the G allele: mean (SD) 1.89% (0.75%) per month versus 0.7% (0.7%) per month (p = 0.0009). No woman homozygous for the A allele was a nonresponder, compared with 56% (21 out of 37) of the men carrying the G allele.


Conclusions
The rs6923761G→A gene variant and sex profoundly affect weight loss in response to semaglutide in patients with severe obesity.

         <title>Less frequent dosing of GLP‐1 receptor agonists as a viable weight maintenance strategy</title>
         <description>Obesity, Volume 33, Issue 7, Page 1232-1236, July 2025. </description>

Abstract

Objective
Incretin mimetics are revolutionizing obesity treatment, but high prices and supply shortages limit patient access. Some clinicians have suggested less frequent dosing as an off‐ramping strategy to maintain weight loss, but this approach lacks published evidence regarding its weight loss efficacy. We aim to provide such clinical evidence and to rationalize these results with mathematical modeling.


Methods
We present a real‐world case series of two patients who took their incretin mimetic less frequently than recommended. We complement this case report with a pharmacokinetic‐pharmacodynamic model of virtual patients that simulates long‐term weight change with semaglutide and tirzepatide administered at various frequencies.


Results
Both real‐world and virtual patients maintained significant weight loss under reduced dosing frequencies. Our results indicate that reducing frequency does not commensurately reduce efficacy. The majority of weight loss persists even when patients wait 2, 3, or perhaps even 4 weeks between doses.


Conclusions
Our findings support the hypothesis that less frequent administration of incretin mimetics can be a viable and cost‐saving long‐term weight maintenance strategy in conjunction with sustained lifestyle modification. Further research is warranted to validate the effectiveness of this off‐label approach, define optimal dosing regimens to meet individual patient needs, and evaluate the cost–benefit implications.

         <title>Titration and discontinuation of semaglutide for weight management in commercially insured US adults</title>
         <description>Obesity, Volume 33, Issue 7, Page 1243-1248, July 2025. </description>

Abstract

Objective
The objective of this study is to examine real‐world dose titration patterns of semaglutide for weight management (Wegovy, Novo Nordisk A/S) in US adults and identify characteristics associated with early discontinuation.


Methods
We identified 15,811 commercially insured adults who started semaglutide for weight management (administrated through single‐dose prefilled pens) between June 2021 and December 2023. We depicted dose‐titration patterns over 5 months and identified factors associated with discontinuation using multivariable Cox regression. Sensitivity analyses examined patterns after supply shortage resolution (after October 2023).


Results
Most semaglutide users deviated from the recommended monthly dose‐escalation schedule within the first 5 months. By the fifth month, nearly one‐half (46%) had discontinued the treatment, with similar rates (48%) among those initiating after supply stabilization. Discontinuation was strongly associated with copayment amount, with rates increased from 41% in the lowest quintile ($1–$54 per month) to 51% in the highest quintile ($161–$1460 per month). Higher discontinuation rates were also associated with lower household income and education level.


Conclusions
The deviations from the recommended dose‐escalation schedule and high discontinuation rate among real‐world semaglutide users indicate important challenges in the delivery of evidence‐based care. Policy interventions that reduce financial barriers to the persistence of semaglutide are needed.

         <title>Lipid‐associated macrophages are more abundant in subcutaneous than visceral adipose tissue in patients with obesity</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
Because white adipose tissue is infiltrated by several immune cells and their signature in individuals with obesity has not been fully characterized, we wanted to study the most abundant population, which is macrophages, a subtype of myeloid cell.


Methods
To address this objective, we performed transcriptomic analysis of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT)‐ and visceral adipose tissue (VAT)‐infiltrated CD11b+ myeloid cells from individuals with severe obesity.


Results
Our results showed that gene expression in human white adipose tissue–infiltrated CD11b+ myeloid cells was depot‐dependent. The expression of lipid‐associated macrophage biomarkers was higher in SAT‐ than VAT‐infiltrated CD11b+ cells (TREM2, CD9, GPNMB, CD68). In contrast, VAT‐infiltrated CD11b+ cells overexpressed genes associated with a perivascular M2‐like adipose tissue macrophage signature (LYVE1, TIMD4, MRC1). In addition, no classical gene expression polarization (M1 and M2) was shown when VAT and SAT CD11b+ cells were compared. Finally, high levels of CD248, a sensor of lipids associated with insulin resistance, were found to be overexpressed in SAT‐ compared with VAT‐infiltrated CD11b+ myeloid cells.


Conclusions
This study characterizes for the first time the macrophage biomarker signature in human VAT‐ and SAT‐infiltrated CD11b+ myeloid cells from individuals with severe obesity. Further studies are required to elucidate their potential role and specific function in the immunometabolism of individuals with obesity.

The expression of lipid-associated macrophage biomarkers was higher in SAT- than VAT-infiltrated CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells (&lt;i&gt;TREM2, CD9, GPNMB, CD68&lt;/i&gt;). In contrast, VAT-infiltrated CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells overexpressed genes associated with a perivascular M2-like adipose tissue macrophage signature (&lt;i&gt;LYVE1, TIMD4, MRC1&lt;/i&gt;). In addition, no classical gene expression polarization (M1 and M2) was shown when VAT and SAT CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were compared. Finally, high levels of &lt;i&gt;CD248&lt;/i&gt;, a sensor of lipids associated with insulin resistance, were found to be overexpressed in SAT- compared with VAT-infiltrated CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; myeloid cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study characterizes for the first time the macrophage biomarker signature in human VAT- and SAT-infiltrated CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; myeloid cells from individuals with severe obesity. Further studies are required to elucidate their potential role and specific function in the immunometabolism of individuals with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tirzepatide for reduction of morbidity and mortality in adults with obesity: rationale and design of the SURMOUNT‐MMO trial</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
Obesity is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Tirzepatide is a glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor and glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist providing substantial weight reduction and metabolic benefits both in type 2 diabetes and obesity. We hypothesized that tirzepatide can improve morbidity and mortality in adults with obesity or overweight but without diabetes.


Methods
SURMOUNT‐MMO is a randomized, double‐blind, event‐driven trial to investigate the impact on morbidity and mortality with once‐weekly tirzepatide compared with placebo in adults living with obesity, without diabetes, and with, or at risk of, cardiovascular disease. The primary endpoint is time to first occurrence of a five‐component composite outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, heart failure events, or death from any cause.


Results
The trial will enroll ~15,000 participants aged ≥40 from 664 sites across 27 countries with BMI ≥27.0 kg/m2 and either established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors.


Conclusions
SURMOUNT‐MMO will provide evidence of the clinical benefits of tirzepatide on multiple outcomes among individuals with overweight or obesity but without diabetes. This is the first outcome trial of an incretin medication that assesses both primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention.

         <title>Fat taste sensitivity in women with obesity: transcriptomic analysis of fungiform papillae before and after bariatric surgery</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
Fat taste sensitivity has been implicated in long‐term weight loss after bariatric surgery. Unexpectedly, improvement of orosensory fat acuity was not systematic in operated patients.


Methods
Obesity‐induced alterations of gene expression in gustatory papillae having been recently reported, we have explored the fungiform transcriptomic activity in the bariatric surgery context. Fat taste detection thresholds (three‐alternative ascending forced‐choice tests) alongside transcriptomic profiling of freshly isolated fungiform papillae were assessed in women with severe obesity before and 6 months after sleeve gastrectomy.


Results
According to evolution of post surgery detection thresholds, lipid‐improved and ‐unimproved subgroups were identified, despite similar initial anthropometric parameters. Lower weight loss and higher plasma fasting insulin, C‐reactive protein, and fibrinogen levels distinguished lipid‐unimproved patients. This subgroup also overexpressed genes involved in inflammation and apoptosis, with certain ones being positively correlated with high lipid detection thresholds (low sensitivity), whereas the key gene of taste bud cell signaling, TRPM5, was down‐expressed. In lipid‐improved patients, genes implicated in cell renewal, neuronal function, and receptor recycling were upregulated and associated with better lipid detection efficiency. Pathway enrichment identified immune and anti‐inflammatory activities in lipid‐unimproved and ‐improved groups, respectively.


Conclusions
These findings collectively suggest that changes in gene expression within gustatory papillae contribute to fat taste sensitivity after sleeve gastrectomy.

         <title>Variations in weight loss and glycemic outcomes after sleeve gastrectomy by race and ethnicity</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
This study examined racial and ethnic differences in percent total weight loss (%TWL) and glycemic improvement following sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and explored the role of socioeconomic and psychosocial factors in postsurgical outcomes.


Methods
This longitudinal study included patients who underwent SG between 2017 and 2020, with follow‐up visits over 24 months.


Results
Non‐Hispanic Black (NHB) participants had lower %TWL at 3, 12, and 24 months compared with Hispanic (H) and non‐Hispanic White (NHW) participants. Fat mass index was initially lower in NHB, with smaller reductions over time and significant group differences persisting at 24 months. NHB participants had higher baseline fat‐free mass index values; by 24 months, fat‐free mass index values were lower in H participants. Hemoglobin A1c decreased across all groups but remained consistently higher in NHB and H compared with NHW at 24 months. NHB participants reported higher perceived discrimination, sleep disturbance, and perceived stress than H and NHW participants at all time points. Employment status predicted %TWL at 12 months. There was a significant interaction between race and ethnicity and employment status observed at 12 and 24 months, suggesting that employment‐related disparities could impact surgical outcomes.


Conclusions
NHB participants experienced less favorable outcomes following SG, emphasizing the need for tailored interventions addressing socioeconomic and psychosocial disparities.

         <title>Effects of obesity‐associated plasma markers on adipose stem cell function and epigenetic regulation</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
This study investigates the correlations between obesity‐related plasma markers and epigenetic/inflammatory changes in white adipose tissue (WAT), focusing on adipose‐derived stem cells (ASCs). We hypothesize that obesity modulates histone H3K27 marks, modified by demethylases (lysine‐specific demethylase 6A and 6B [KDM6A/KDM6B]) and acetylases (CREB–binding protein [CREBBP]/histone acetyltransferase EP300), affecting ASC function.


Methods
Serum and visceral WAT (omental region) was collected from male patients (n = 16, 30–50 years old) undergoing elective gastric or bariatric surgery. BMI and obesity markers were correlated with changes in ASCs (transcript expression, proliferation, and secretion) using reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction.


Results
ASCs from individuals with higher BMI exhibited slower proliferation, increased inflammatory profile, and reduced adipogenic potential, with lower expression of key adipogenic genes. H3K27 acetylase transcripts were also negatively correlated with adipogenesis regulators. Moreover, C‐C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2) and KDM6A expression was higher in the group with obesity, as were CREBBP and EP300. Finally, leptin levels positively correlated with serum, WAT, and ASC CCL2 expression. In vitro, leptin exposure enhanced CCL2 expression/secretion and increased KDM6A/KDM6B and EP300 transcription.


Conclusions
In vitro leptin exposure enhanced CCL2 expression/secretion and increased KDM6A/KDM6B and EP300 transcription, highlighting how obesity‐driven epigenetic mechanisms, including leptin‐mediated pathways, disrupt ASC plasticity and perpetuate adipose tissue dysfunction, offering novel therapeutic targets for metabolic disease intervention.

         <title>Changes in weight and glycemic control following obesity treatment with semaglutide or tirzepatide by discontinuation status</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract

Objective
The objective of this study was to characterize changes in body weight and glycated hemoglobin (in those with prediabetes at baseline) through 12 months by obesity pharmacotherapy discontinuation status.


Methods
This retrospective cohort study used electronic health record data from a large health system in Ohio and Florida to identify adults with overweight or obesity without type 2 diabetes who initiated injectable semaglutide or tirzepatide between 2021 and 2023. Treatment discontinuation was defined by a &gt;90‐day gap between exhaustion of previous supply and next dispense or end of study follow‐up (December 2024) and was classified into early discontinuation (i.e., within 3 months of index date) and late discontinuation (i.e., within 3–12 months).


Results
We identified 7881 patients; 6109 received semaglutide, and 1772 received tirzepatide. A total of 80.8% had low maintenance dosages. Mean (SD) percentage weight reduction at 1 year was 8.7% (9.6%); and it was 3.6% (8.1%) with early discontinuation, 6.8% (9.1%) with late discontinuation, and 11.9% (9.2%) with non‐discontinuation (p &lt; 0.001). The mean (SD) absolute reduction in percent glycated hemoglobin at 1 year was 0.1 (0.4) with early discontinuation, 0.2 (0.4) with late discontinuation, and 0.4 (0.4) with non‐discontinuation (p &lt; 0.001).


Conclusions
The average weight reduction in this cohort was lower than that observed in the main phase 3 trials, likely because of higher rates of discontinuation and lower maintenance dosages.

         <title>Nutritional priorities to support GLP‐1 therapy for obesity: A joint Advisory from the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, the American Society for Nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and The Obesity Society</title>

Abstract

Background
Glucagon‐like peptide 1 receptor agonists and combination medications (hereafter collectively referred to as GLP‐1s) are shifting the treatment landscape for obesity. However, real‐world challenges and limited clinician and public knowledge on nutritional and lifestyle interventions can limit GLP‐1 efficacy, equitable results, and cost‐effectiveness.


Objectives
We aimed to identify pragmatic priorities for nutrition and other lifestyle interventions relevant to GLP‐1 treatment of obesity for the practicing clinician.


Methods
An expert group comprising multiple clinical and research disciplines appraised the scientific literature, informed by expert knowledge and clinical experience, to identify and summarize relevant topics, priorities, and emerging directions.


Results
GLP‐1s reduce body weight by 5% to 18% in trials, with modestly lower effects in real‐world analyses, and multiple demonstrated clinical benefits. Challenges include side effects, especially gastrointestinal; nutritional deficiencies due to calorie reduction; muscle and bone loss; low long‐term adherence with subsequent weight regain; and high costs with resulting low cost‐effectiveness. Numerous practice guidelines recommend multicomponent, evidence‐based nutritional and behavioral therapy for adults with obesity, but use of such therapies with GLP‐1s is not widespread. Priorities to address this include: (a) patient‐centered initiation of GLP‐1s, including goals for weight reduction and health; (b) baseline screening, including usual dietary habits, emotional triggers, disordered eating, and relevant medical conditions; (c) comprehensive exam including muscle strength, function, and body composition assessment; (d) social determinants of health screening; (e) and lifestyle assessment including aerobic activity, strength training, sleep, mental stress, substance use, and social connections. During GLP‐1 use, nutritional and medical management of gastrointestinal side effects is critical, as is navigating altered dietary preferences and intakes, preventing nutrient deficiencies, preserving muscle and bone mass through resistance training and appropriate diet, and complementary lifestyle interventions. Supportive strategies include group‐based visits, registered dietitian nutritionist counseling, telehealth and digital platforms, and Food is Medicine interventions. Drug access, food and nutrition insecurity, and nutrition and culinary knowledge influence equitable obesity management with GLP‐1s. Emerging areas for more study include dietary modulation of endogenous GLP‐1, strategies to improve compliance, nutritional priorities for weight maintenance post‐cessation, combination or staged intensive lifestyle management, and diagnostic criteria for clinical obesity.


Conclusions
Evidence‐based nutritional and lifestyle strategies play a pivotal role to address key challenges around GLP‐1 treatment of obesity, making clinicians more effective in advancing their patients' health.

         <title>Genetic and environmental contributions to the associations between midlife personality and late‐life metabolic health</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
Personality traits such as conscientiousness and emotional stability are consistently linked with better metabolic health, but there is limited evidence on the etiology of these associations and their robustness across the life‐span.


Methods
Therefore, we estimated phenotypic, genetic, and unique environmental associations of traits indexed by the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire in early‐to‐middle adulthood (mean age = 38.3 years) with BMI, waist circumference, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, C‐reactive protein, triglycerides, and glycated hemoglobin in older adulthood (mean age = 70.4 years) using the Minnesota Twin Registry sample (n = 950).


Results
Traits that indexed emotional instability in midlife, such as alienation and stress reactivity, were significant predictors of several metabolic outcomes late in life (bivariate |r| ≤ 0.22), whereas negative associations with traits related to conscientiousness (e.g., control, constraint, achievement) tended to be more modest. For most traits that were phenotypically associated, we observed significant genetic correlations. Additionally, alienation and stress reactivity had weak‐to‐moderate unique environmental correlations with BMI, waist circumference, and C‐reactive protein (re = 0.10–0.29).


Conclusions
These results are consistent with an etiology of declining metabolic health into old age involving the propensity toward negative affective experiences decades prior, further validating the health relevance of individual differences in personality.

         <title>BMI‐for‐age percentile curves for older adults</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
The objective of this manuscript is to present BMI‐for‐age percentile curves for men and women aged 45 to 90 years.


Methods
Weighted empirical percentile estimates were calculated using data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) comprehensive cohort (2011–2018) according to age and sex. Statistical smoothing procedures were used to generate smoothed curves for the percentile values. Overweight and obesity were defined as BMI greater than the 85th and 95th percentile for age and sex, respectively.


Results
In order to create BMI‐for‐age percentile curves, n = 56,705 observations were used (n = 29,961 individuals at baseline and n = 26,744 individuals at the first follow‐up visit). In men, absolute values for BMI percentiles are lower than those in women, and the decline in BMI begins earlier (i.e., at a younger age). In women, the 95th percentile threshold for BMI is highest between ages 59 and 67 years (i.e., 41 kg/m2), and in men, the 95th percentile threshold for BMI is highest between ages 51 and 62 years (i.e., 39 kg/m2).


Conclusions
BMI‐for‐age percentile curves demonstrate how an individual's BMI value compares with values from a reference population comprising individuals of the same age and sex. This approach has widespread utility to determine eligibility for interventions and as a tool to incorporate into clinical models of care for obesity management in an aging population.

The impact of lifestyle‐based weight loss in older adults on muscle and bone health: a balancing act.







Abstract
Despite adverse metabolic and functional consequences of obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), clinical recommendations for weight loss (WL) in older adults (65+ years) with obesity remain controversial. Reluctance stems partly from epidemiologic data demonstrating musculoskeletal tissue loss with WL and increased risk of disability and osteoporotic fracture. Randomized controlled trials in older adults complement and extend knowledge in this area showing: (1) lifestyle‐based WL interventions often yield clinically meaningful (~8%–10%) WL in older adults; (2) lean mass loss is significant, although fat mass loss is preferential and physical performance is often improved, particularly when combined with aerobic and resistance training (RT); (3) bone loss is also significant, with some evidence that RT can attenuate WL‐associated bone loss; and (4) fat mass regain after intervention cessation is common, yet physical performance gains appear to be maintained. Best practices for treating older adults with obesity include comprehensive assessment of baseline musculoskeletal health; patient‐centered goal setting; moderate (i.e., −500 kcal/day) caloric restriction ensuring protein (1–1.2 g/kg/day), calcium (1000–1200 mg/day), and vitamin D (800–1000 IU/day) needs are met; incorporation of RT (≥2 days/week) and moderate‐intensity weight‐bearing aerobic training (≥150 min/week); and delivery of care by a multidisciplinary team.

Randomized controlled trials in older adults complement and extend knowledge in this area showing: (1) lifestyle-based WL interventions often yield clinically meaningful (~8%–10%) WL in older adults; (2) lean mass loss is significant, although fat mass loss is preferential and physical performance is often improved, particularly when combined with aerobic and resistance training (RT); (3) bone loss is also significant, with some evidence that RT can attenuate WL-associated bone loss; and (4) fat mass regain after intervention cessation is common, yet physical performance gains appear to be maintained. Best practices for treating older adults with obesity include comprehensive assessment of baseline musculoskeletal health; patient-centered goal setting; moderate (i.e., −500 kcal/day) caloric restriction ensuring protein (1–1.2 g/kg/day), calcium (1000–1200 mg/day), and vitamin D (800–1000 IU/day) needs are met; incorporation of RT (≥2 days/week) and moderate-intensity weight-bearing aerobic training (≥150 min/week); and delivery of care by a multidisciplinary team.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Musculoskeletal characteristics in older adults with overweight or obesity: INVEST in Bone Health trial baseline analysis</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract

Objective
The objective of this study was to examine associations of computed tomography (CT)‐derived musculoskeletal measures with demographics and traditional musculoskeletal characteristics.


Methods
The Incorporating Nutrition, Vests, Education, and Strength Training (INVEST) in Bone Health trial (NCT04076618) acquired a battery of musculoskeletal measures in 150 older‐aged adults living with overweight or obesity. At baseline, CT (i.e., volumetric bone mineral density, cortical thickness, muscle radiomics, and muscle/intermuscular adipose tissue [IMAT] area and density), dual‐energy x‐ray absorptiometry (DXA; i.e., areal bone mineral density, total body fat mass, appendicular lean mass, and lean body mass), and strength assessments (i.e., grip and knee extensor strength) were collected, along with demographic and clinical characteristics. Analyses employed linear regression and mixed‐effects models along with factor analysis for dimensionality reduction of the radiomics data.


Results
Participants were older‐aged (mean [SD] age: 66 [5] years), mostly female (75%), and were living with overweight or obesity (mean [SD] BMI: 33.6 [3.3] kg/m2). Age was not significantly associated with most CT‐derived bone, IMAT, or muscle measures. BMI was significantly associated with DXA and CT‐derived muscle and IMAT measures, which were higher in male than female individuals (all p &lt; 0.01). For the midthigh, muscle size was significantly related to grip and knee extensor strength (both p &lt; 0.01).


Conclusions
Machine learning‐derived CT metrics correlated strongly with DXA and muscle strength, with higher BMI linked to greater IMAT and poorer muscle quality.

         <title>Efficacy of antiobesity medications for weight reduction in older adults: a systematic review</title>
         <description>Obesity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract

Objective
The objective of this study was to examine weight reduction and adverse events associated with use of antiobesity medications (AOMs) in older adults ages ≥65 years.


Methods
Seven databases were searched for studies evaluating weight reduction of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved AOMs. Studies had to include adults ages ≥65 years with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 or ≥27 kg/m2 with one weight‐related condition), with independent analysis of weight reduction for adults ages ≥65 years. Two coauthors extracted and evaluated studies for risk of bias using standardized forms.


Results
Six experimental studies (five secondary analyses of randomized clinical trial data and one single‐arm trial) and two observational studies met inclusion criteria. Seven medications were studied. Sample size of older adults ranged from 13 to 6728. Experimental studies predominantly included patients with concurrent prediabetes or cardiovascular disease. All studies found statistically significant weight reduction between intervention and placebo groups or compared with baseline weight. Few studies reported on adverse events.


Conclusions
Limited evidence suggests weight reduction of AOMs in older adults, with the best current evidence for the use of semaglutide in older adults with obesity and cardiovascular disease. Larger, more inclusive studies of older adults are needed to guide clinical care and determine the tolerability of AOMs for older adults.
