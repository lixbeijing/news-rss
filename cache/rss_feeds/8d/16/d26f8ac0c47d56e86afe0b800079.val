					<description><![CDATA[<p>Collagen supplements are on trend, especially for skin health. Now I dig deeper into how they could benefit joints, especially for people with arthritis.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/collagen-supplements-for-arthritis/">Arthritis relief: can collagen supplements help?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au">Thinking Nutrition</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Interest in collagen supplements continues to grow – and for good reason. That’s because despite rubbish claims that are way off the mark that there is ‘no evidence they work’ and ‘the collagen industry funds all the research’, the reality is very different. In past blog posts, I’ve delved into hydrolysed collagen supplements and skin health. There are now dozens of blinded randomised controlled trials showing a consistent benefit in increasing skin moisture and elasticity and reducing wrinkles. However, for this article, I want to focus on another reason people may take collagen: to relieve joint pain and stiffness from arthritis. Read on as I outline what the clinical trial evidence has to say and what biological mechanisms could be at play to support a beneficial effect of collagen supplements for arthritis.</em></p>

<p>The topic of collagen supplements is one I’ve <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/category/collagen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">covered many times</a> on this blog. That’s because what the science has to say about some of the health claims, especially around skin health, is becoming more and more of a positive news story. This contrasts with newspaper article after article dismissing it out of hand for a variety of….well, completely wrong reasons which I’ll outline shortly.</p>



<p>If you want to get up to speed on hydrolysed collagen in skin health, you can check out this <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/collagen-supplements-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">post</a>. And then there is this <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/collagen-tendon-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">article</a> I wrote recently about the emerging role of collagen supplements in tendon injury repair and recovery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Collagen 101</strong></h2>



<p>So a bit of background on the collagen story to date. Collagen is the most abundant protein in our body, making up 30 percent of our total body protein. Its primary role in the body is to serve as a major structural protein. Collagen is present in many tissues including tendons, ligaments, cartilage, blood vessels and skin.</p>



<p>The collagen protein is constructed by three intertwined amino acid chains. These amino acid chains are largely composed of repeating units of glycine (which is every third amino acid), proline and hydroxyproline. That last one hydroxyproline is unique to collagen and is derived from proline which needs vitamin C for this to happen. Scurvy, a disease of vitamin C deficiency, presents as extremely weak collagen.</p>



<p>Collagen is not a single molecule; there are 28 distinct types. The most abundant are types I, II and III. Type I collagen is found in tendons, ligaments, corneas, bones and skin. Type III collagen is typically found alongside type I collagen in the skin and blood vessels. While type II collagen is mostly found in cartilage.</p>



<p>Hydrolysed collagen is the most common form in the supplement market. When native collagen is heated, it denatures to form gelatin. However, gelatin has low solubility so hydrolysing collagen creates shorter amino acid chains, increasing their solubility and absorption </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It’s all about the peptides</strong></h3>



<p>When collagen is eaten, it is digested and absorbed into the bloodstream. Soon after, both single amino acids and unique dipeptides and tripeptides appear. These small peptides have a unique fingerprint because of the presence of the amino acid hydroxyproline. Remember, hydroxyproline is unique to collagen so these small peptide fragments only exist in the blood from the breakdown of our collagen or from the collagen we eat.</p>



<p>Absorbed collagen peptides not only redistribute to the skin but can act as signalling molecules, binding to receptors on the surface of fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are skin cells that are major producers of collagen. This receptor binding stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen, elastin (which is needed for skin elasticity) and hyaluronic acid (for water retention). This is such a vital point as it provides a plausible mechanism by which collagen consumption could directly affect our skin. And similar types of pathways exist in cells that produce collagen found in cartilage and tendons.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Collagen for skin health</strong></h2>



<p>So, can collagen supplements promote healthy skin? As I outlined in my <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/collagen-supplements-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">earlier post</a> on this topic, from 19 clinical trials, supplementation with hydrolysed collagen had a statistically significant effect on skin hydration, skin elasticity, skin density and wrinkles. Effective collagen doses used in the trials ranged from 0.6 g to 12 g per day for 1 to 3 months. And not a single study reported an adverse health problem from taking collagen.</p>



<p>But research never stands still and there has been yet more research since then. So much so, that late in 2023, a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10180699/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">new systematic review</a> was published. This updated review could analyse 26 randomised controlled trials of oral collagen supplements that looked at skin hydration and skin elasticity.</p>



<p>And just like in prior reviews, a significant benefit was seen with almost every study pointing in the right direction for a positive benefit.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Playing the ‘industry funding’ card</strong></h3>



<p>But isn’t all the research funded by the collagen industry? No. Of those 26 studies on skin health I just mentioned, 11 had no funding from the collagen industry (trust me, I checked) nor did any of the research team report a conflict of interest. And these ‘untainted’ trials were just as likely to show a benefit as those with industry links. Playing the ‘industry funding’ card is a lazy form of critical analysis.</p>



<p>Sure, you can always find fault with any individual study. But for anyone to claim that there is ‘no evidence collagen supplements work’ is living in scientific denial. If anything, I am more sceptical of people who dismiss collagen out of hand. That was a valid position 10 years ago with a limited research base. But not today. And especially when faced with growing evidence across many different health areas where collagen supplements seem to offer a benefit.</p>



<p>And those dismissive claims that collagen is no different to any other protein you eat so it can’t have a unique biological effect are way off the mark. There is a plausible and well-understood mechanism where collagen can have direct effects on collagen production in the body different to any other protein source. That’s because of the unique peptides that are absorbed into the bloodstream after you eat collagen.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Arthritis relief: can collagen supplements help?</strong></h2>



<p>So that’s got you up to speed on collagen. Now for the main topic today and that is what research has to say about another health reason that people may take collagen supplements: and that’s for joint health – especially for the condition of arthritis.</p>



<p>Arthritis is the swelling and tenderness of one or more joints. The main symptoms of arthritis are joint pain and stiffness, which typically worsen with age. The most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>



<p>Osteoarthritis is characterised by a breakdown in cartilage which covers the ends of bones where they form a joint. Osteoarthritis is more common in women and usually affects people from the age of 45 onwards. The parts of the body most commonly affected are the knees, hands, hips and back. So think of this form of arthritis as more like a disease of wear-and-tear causing loss of the protective cartilage.</p>



<p>Rheumatoid arthritis on the other hand is a disease in which the immune system attacks the joints, beginning with the lining of joints.</p>



<p>The differences between these two forms of arthritis are worth noting. That’s because collagen supplements could help with both forms, but act through different mechanisms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Collagen for osteoarthritis</strong></h2>



<p>Osteoarthritis is common – afflicting more than <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/osteoarthritis" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">500 million people</a> worldwide. This article though is not about the current medical management of this painful condition. Treatment centres around the use of pain-relieving anti-inflammatory medications along with positive lifestyle changes such as regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight.</p>



<p>Where the interest in collagen supplements arises is from the observation that cartilage is mostly made up of collagen – in particular type II collagen. Contrast that with skin where types I and III collagens are predominant. But just because cartilage is made up of mostly collagen, does that mean taking a collagen supplement will help repair it?</p>



<p>If we look at the extensive research already done on collagen supplements and skin health, we can clearly see specific effects of oral hydrolysed collagen. So it isn’t such a crazy stretch to think there could be some benefit on the joints too. Interestingly, from <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ten.TEA.2011.0416" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">in vitro cell culture studies</a>, exposing chondrocyte cells (which are the cells responsible for cartilage production) to collagen shows an increase in collagen production.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What do clinical trials have to say?</strong></h3>



<p>So let’s move on to the real stuff of interest and see what clinical trials have to say about collagen supplements for helping with osteoarthritis. And fortunately, there have been quite a few published. Not to the level seen for skin health, but certainly enough to assess a possible benefit.</p>



<p>The initial collection of research on collagen and osteoarthritis in humans came from a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00264-018-4211-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">systematic review</a> published in 2018. Five randomised controlled trials involving over 500 people could be analysed where people with osteoarthritis took oral collagen supplements or a placebo for 10 to 48 weeks. Arthritis symptoms of pain, stiffness and physical function were assessed by use of both a validated scoring scale as well as self-reported measures. Four of the studies used hydrolysed collagen taken at between 2 to 10 grams per day while the fifth study used 40 milligrams of undenatured type II collagen. I’ll write more about this special type of undenatured collagen shortly.</p>



<p>So what did the review uncover? The news was very positive. There was a clear significant reduction in arthritis symptoms which was reflected in the pooled data of all the studies, but also evident when you looked at individual studies which mostly all reported a significant benefit. There was though a lot of variability seen between studies, but this is not so surprising when you consider differences in doses of collagen used as well as the length of treatment.</p>



<p>With just 5 studies included, this review is by no means a ‘slam dunk’ for the benefit of collagen in osteoarthritis, but it is giving a very positive signal. But the review only included research published before 2018. What has happened since then?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The latest research</strong></h3>



<p>In March 2023 a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10058045/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">new review</a> was published looking at collagen supplementation in joint health. It made an effort to summarise the research to date, and for hydrolysed collagen and osteoarthritis, 6 randomised controlled trials and 3 observational studies were looked at.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, there was a large degree of variability between the studies in terms of study designs, comparators, dosages, collagen source and treatment length. Yet despite this, all of the studies could show some degree of improvement in osteoarthritis symptoms. Self-reported improvements in physical function, quality of life and pain showed the greatest level of improvement. And keep in mind, most of the studies were blinded so the participants weren’t aware if they were taking collagen or a placebo so this removes some level of bias from the expectation of a benefit.</p>



<p>Interestingly, <a href="https://www.oarsijournal.com/article/S1063-4584(11)00014-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">one study</a> from the review looked specifically at proteoglycan content in knee cartilage which saw an increase in its content. Proteoglycan is used as a proxy measure of cartilage production so this provides some evidence that collagen supplementation could be restoring some of the collagen lost in osteoarthritis. And remember, at least in cell culture studies, you can see greater collagen synthesis in cartilage-producing chondrocyte cells when exposed to hydrolysed collagen.</p>



<p>Hydrolysed collagen via its absorbed peptides is also proposed to have an anti-inflammatory action. So this could also be an explanation for an improvement in some of the arthritis symptoms seen in the research.</p>



<p>So I would firmly say that the research is looking positive so far and while ‘more research is always needed’, even an uber-sceptical person would be unwise to dismiss claims about a benefit of hydrolysed collagen in osteoarthritis at this stage. All from something that is a food and has no real adverse events linked to it outside of a person already having some degree of sensitivity to it. But this applies to all forms of collagen in food – not just supplements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is this ‘undenatured collagen’ stuff?</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s circle back to that random form of collagen I mentioned earlier which is undenatured type II collagen. Undenatured simply means the collagen protein hasn’t been unwound and degraded so it is the pure, fully functional protein without any structural deformation. To isolate this from an animal source needs some very careful treatment because acid, heat and enzymes are going to destroy the protein. Not a problem if you’re talking about hydrolysed collagen as you want the peptides, but undenatured collagen is a different beast.</p>



<p>So why the interest in this form of collagen? Firstly, it is type II collagen that is isolated (usually from chicken sternums) as that is the predominant form found in cartilage. When you consume undenatured protein, it can have a specific immune-mediated mechanism of action known as oral tolerance.</p>



<p>Oral tolerance allows us to tolerate and not mount an immune response against ingested substances like food antigens or harmless microorganisms found in the gut. In theory, this can lead to a decrease in autoimmune reactions against collagen in cartilage. This contrasts with the effects of hydrolysed collagen which are thought to have positive effects on cartilage collagen synthesis.</p>



<p>There has been quite a bit of research looking at undenatured type II collagen in osteoarthritis. Only last year, a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10579002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">systematic review</a> was published. Eight randomised controlled trials involving 243 people were included where undenatured type II collagen or a placebo was given to adults with knee osteoarthritis. The dose used in most of the trials was 40 milligrams. Yes, you read correctly, that’s ‘milligrams’ compared to grams of hydrolysed collagen used in other studies. That’s because we’re talking about a possible immune effect going on.</p>



<p>So what did the review find? From the meta-analysis, it was again possible to see an indication for a benefit with collagen supplementation reducing pain and severity of arthritis. The studies showed a low degree of potential bias which is good. Yes, there was a lot of individual variability between the studies, but they were all pointing in the right direction for a benefit.</p>



<p>Now don’t go looking for undenatured type II collagen from your local pharmacy or friendly collagen Insta influencer. It is a much more specialised supplement, but you’ll find it easily enough with a bit of Internet searching.</p>



<p>Considering the effects of undenatured type II collagen could be via the immune system, it raises the question of how it may work for rheumatoid arthritis which has its origin in the immune system. In vitro and animal studies suggest undenatured type II collagen can have anti-inflammatory effects. While <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10058045/">pilot clinical trials</a> find that undenatured type II collagen may stimulate immune suppression and improve rheumatoid arthritis symptoms though results so far are mixed. I see the evidence as looking much stronger for collagen supplements and osteoarthritis at this stage, but I’m keeping a watch on this space closely.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What it all means</strong></h2>



<p>So, let’s wrap all this up. For collagen supplements, it can read like a shopping list of health benefits that sound too good to be true. But this is a rare case that there is a good base of science to support many of the claims made about collagen.  And this is coming from a career research scientist who has seen all manner of fads and trends come and go with most not supported by much science.</p>



<p>There is now plenty of research to read. So I suggest you digest some of that to form your own views rather than get your advice from the latest newspaper article dismissing collagen supplements out of hand for completely wrong reasons.</p>



<p>In the end, it is your choice if you want to trial collagen for skin or joint health and you can make your own personal assessment. As even with plenty of clinical trials to support a benefit, every person’s response in those trials was different so the final judge of if there is a benefit is going to be the person taking it.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/collagen-supplements-for-arthritis/">Arthritis relief: can collagen supplements help?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au">Thinking Nutrition</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The post <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/lemon-water/">Lemon water: is it worth the squeeze or just sour hype?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au">Thinking Nutrition</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Do you want to lose weight, boost your metabolism, improve your digestion, detox your body, have glowing skin and all while keeping your body nicely alkalised and in balance? You can. All you need do is start the day with a glass of water with the juice of a freshly squeezed lemon added. I mean, water is good for you? And lemons, being a fruit, are good for you? So why not combine the two and get a quantum level of health-boosting synergy! Okay, now for a dose of reality as I explore the whole lemon water trend and pull apart those amazing health claims to see what is hype and what is reality.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Lemon-Water.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Lemon-Water-1024x683.png" alt="lemon water" class="wp-image-6353" srcset="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Lemon-Water-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Lemon-Water-300x200.png 300w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Lemon-Water-768x512.png 768w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Lemon-Water-600x400.png 600w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Lemon-Water.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Lemon water is all the rage these days. A quick search of the Internet finds no shortage of glowing health reports claiming how it can improve digestion, rid the body of toxins, boost weight loss, turbo-charge your immune system and balance the body&#8217;s pH. Oh, and it’s also great for your skin. Sign me up.</p>



<p>So what is lemon water? It’s simply the juice of a lemon added to hot or cold water and usually drunk on an empty stomach first thing in the morning. Some people may add a few additional ingredients like honey, mint, turmeric or cayenne pepper, but it is the lemon water that is the base drink and that’s what I’ll focus on for this blog post.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s in your lemon?</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s dive straight into all of the nutritional goodness you get in your glass of lemon water. If you used a very generous squeeze of lemon (let’s call it 50 mL of juice), then you’ll be getting about 40 kilojoules (10 Calories) and about 20 milligrams of vitamin C. That quantity of vitamin C is a bit under half the recommended daily amount for an adult if you use <a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/nutrient-reference-values/nutrients/vitamin-c" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Australian and New Zealand recommendations</a> and about a third of daily requirements if you use <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/#h2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">US recommendations</a>. So not an insignificant amount of vitamin C to be sure.</p>



<p>Vitamin C has many important roles in the body. One of those is its essential role in the production of collagen. Collagen is responsible for the elasticity and strength of skin and this is why some of the signs and symptoms of scurvy relate to bleeding gums, poor wound healing and bruising.</p>



<p>Fun fact: over 250 years ago (and well before vitamin C was characterised and named as a vitamin), it was the British physician James Lind who all but eradicated the terrible disease scurvy which was rampant among British sailors on long sea voyages caused by the lack of vitamin C from fresh foods in their diet. He did this through controlled experiments to finally settle on the juice of lemons or limes as the key food to restore them to health and prevent scurvy from occurring in the first place.</p>



<p>So yep, if you’re at risk of scurvy, then lemon water will certainly be of huge benefit. Of course, any citrus fruit will give you loads of vitamin C. Eating an orange or kiwi fruit in fact would give you<a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/#h3" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""> four&#8211;times the amount</a> compared to your lemon water. And foods like broccoli, tomatoes, red capsicum and a whole bunch of others are also great sources.</p>



<p>So if you’re relying on mainly lemon water to get your vitamin C for the day for months on end then you’ve got some serious problems going on with your diet and lifestyle. Maybe get that sorted first.</p>



<p>After vitamin C though, it is a fail as far as the nutritional profile goes for lemon water for getting close to any other of your nutrient needs apart from the biggest one of all: water.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Water, water everywhere</strong></h2>



<p>So let’s look at water. If you’re struggling to get enough water each day, then lemon water will certainly help. And if the citrus tang encourages you to drink more, then that isn’t such a bad thing. Especially if you are replacing soft drinks, sports drinks and even fruit juices with lemon water – that’s a lot less sugar and calories you’ll be having in your diet.</p>



<p>Swapping out sugary drinks for lemon water will be better for your health, but so too would….plain water. But if you prefer lemon water, then I’m certainly not going to knock it for being a good source of water and a way to cut down on sugar in your diet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Will you lose weight?</strong></h2>



<p>What about those weight loss claims attributed to lemon water? There’s nothing that special or outstanding about them because if you’re drinking lemon water in place of food or other liquids full of calories then that can be enough to kick-start weight loss.</p>



<p>When people increase their water consumption, especially before meals, and replace calorie-filled beverages with water, then at least in the short&#8211;term, it can result in a small amount of weight loss if the habit is maintained. A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31657610/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">2019 review</a> on this topic found an average of 5% weight loss when using a mixture of increasing daily water intake, replacing caloric beverages with water, and having a pre-load of water before a meal.</p>



<p>But note how this research was all about water. Adding lemon to the water doesn&#8217;t make it any better or worse for increasing the rate of weight loss or ‘fat burning’.</p>



<p>So let’s call that two wins for lemon water so far: vitamin C and water. But neither property is owned by lemon water and their effects are well-and-truly overhyped when you consider all the other food sources of vitamin C in a person’s diet and how much water they drink over the day in food and beverages that aren’t lemon water.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Good for your digestion</strong></h2>



<p>One bit of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35013789/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">intriguing research</a> has profiled the effect of lemon juice on digestion when consumed at the same time as a meal containing starch. Here, it is the effect of all that lemony acidity that reduces the activity of an enzyme called alpha-amylase which is found in saliva in the mouth. Alpha-amylase is involved in the process of starch breakdown which starts in the mouth.</p>



<p>The effect of acidity on alpha-amylase translates to a lower glycaemic response when lemon juice is drunk with starch-containing food. This could have some relevance to people with diabetes.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t mean you won’t absorb any of the starch in food if you drink lemon water with a meal, only that it may take a bit longer to absorb.</p>



<p>Don’t get too excited though as there is nothing special about lemon juice. Similar effects have been seen with vinegar; be it apple cider vinegar or private label vinegar off the supermarket shelf – it all does the same thing because of its acidity.</p>



<p>So there could be some truth to the claims about lemon juice improving digestion, but the disclaimer here is that you need to drink it at the same time you are eating a meal containing starch. Contrast that with the typical advice about lemon water to do with starting your day with a glass of it to help with digestion. That will have zero effect on your digestion of food as most of the food you eat will be later in the day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Does lemon water ‘boost your metabolism’?</strong></h2>



<p>What about those claims you read of lemon water ‘boosting your metabolism’? There are many pills, supplements and foods that claim to boost metabolism and burn fat. Most of these claims are unproven. Some substances such as caffeine and chilli do have a small effect on metabolic rate, but the effect is very small.</p>



<p>There is no plausible metabolic mechanism for why a glass of diluted lemon juice should do anything to your metabolism short of the tiny amount of energy that your body uses to digest, absorb and move that lemon water along your gut. That is called the <a href="https://examine.com/outcomes/thermic-effect-of-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">thermic effect of food</a> and it is the energy required to digest and assimilate food. It can differ depending on the macronutrient content of the meal with fat having an energy cost of about 5%, carbohydrates about 10% and protein around 25%.</p>



<p>Before you get too excited about all this thermic effect of food theory, you can’t ‘eat yourself thin’. Think of the thermic effect of food as an energy tax on food. But most of the energy in the food you will still make use of.</p>



<p>So considering the amount of energy in a glass of lemon water is tiny to start with, at just a few calories, then the thermic effect of food here is so small as to be effectively zero. But to be kind, let’s call it 1 Calorie for that glass of lemon juice. Ozempic it is not.</p>



<p>But does lemon water boost your energy? The answer is ‘probably’ but it would be from the placebo effect. If you are drinking lemon water because you felt it was good for you and you were all about carpe dieming each morning with your lemon water ritual, then you’ll be giving yourself a bit of positive reinforcement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kidney stones be gone</strong></h2>



<p>One area where there could just be some health benefits of lemon water relates to reducing the risk of recurrence of kidney stones. Kidney stones are hard deposits of minerals and acid salts that stick together in concentrated urine. They are quite common, and people who get them often get them repeatedly.</p>



<p>The citric acid found in lemons (and of course all other citrus fruits), may help reduce the risk of kidney stones recurring. It does this by binding to calcium in the urine which prevents crystal growth by creating a less favourable environment for kidney stone formation.</p>



<p>There is now even clinical trial evidence to support a benefit. A recent <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8683665/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">randomised-controlled trial</a> published in 2022 that built on previous research, found that in 203 people with recurrent kidney stones who drank either 60 mL of fresh lemon juice twice per day or nothing at all, there were lower rates of kidney stone recurrence over two years in those drinking the lemon juice.</p>



<p>So there could just be something to this story of citric acid and kidney stones. There is even some <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/end.2018.0623" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">mixed evidence that lemonade</a> could do something similar. But again, it is the citric acid that is added to these types of drinks that is showing a benefit so please don’t use it as an excuse to down a litre of Sprite each day for your kidney health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Alkalising your body: just say no to pseudoscientific nonsense</strong></h2>



<p>One claim made about lemon juice needs to be called out for the BS that it is: and that has to do with its alleged ‘alkalising’ effect on your body.</p>



<p>Alkaline diets have been promoted for years as a magical cure-all to treat or prevent cancer, heart disease, low energy levels and a whole host of other illnesses. The premise behind the whole alkaline trend is related to something called the acid-ash hypothesis.</p>



<p>It goes like this: when we eat certain foods like meat, poultry, cheese, fish, eggs, and grains, ash is produced in the body. The type of ash is determined by the relative content of acid-forming components in a food such as phosphate and sulphur, and alkali-forming compounds such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Most fruits and vegetables (and that includes lemons even though we think of them as an acid food) form alkali compounds in the body.</p>



<p>Where to start. As with any crazy diet idea, there is always a kernel of truth behind it. It is true that different foods produce different types of metabolic by-products. Alkaline ash is produced by fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes. Neutral foods are more natural fats. And the ‘evil’ acid ash-producing foods are meat, poultry, fish, dairy, eggs, grains and alcohol.</p>



<p>But back to pH and why this diet is pseudoscientific nonsense. pH is, of course, a measure of acidity or alkalinity. The pH scale ranges from 1 to 14 with 1 being strongly acidic, 14 being strongly alkaline, and 7 neutral. Anything below 7 is acidic, and anything above 7 is alkaline (also known as basic).</p>



<p>Your stomach acid and battery acid have a pH of about 1, lemons a pH of 2, grapefruit about 3 and black coffee a 5 or 6. On the other end of the spectrum, seawater is about pH 8, peas are 9, spinach is about 10 and liquid drain cleaner has a pH of 14. I guess Draino would count as a health tonic supplement in the alkaline diet world then.</p>



<p>Advocates pushing the alkaline diet claim that since the normal pH of blood is slightly alkaline at 7.4, then you should eat alkaline foods and shun acidic foods to keep it there.</p>



<p>Here’s the thing: if food really could make an impact on blood pH in either an acidic or alkaline direction it would be life-threatening. A blood pH below 7.35 is called acidosis and above 7.45 it is alkalosis. Both are medical emergencies that can be fatal.</p>



<p>The body keeps blood pH in a very tight range thanks to the coordinated actions of the lungs and kidneys. But anyone who has studied physiology would know this sort of basic stuff. Those promoting an alkaline diet are not in that group.</p>



<p>Food though can change the pH of urine and that&#8217;s one of the regulatory mechanisms the body uses to buffer against too much acidity or alkalinity. Urine though is contained in the bladder so does not affect the pH of any other part of your body.</p>



<p>So, while an alkaline diet may change the pH level in the urine it has not been shown to cause a sustained change in blood pH levels. That’s because our natural acid-base regulatory mechanisms don’t need a special diet to work so any effect of food on blood pH is minimal and transient.</p>



<p>Even when those promoting alkaline diets defer to the fact that acidic foods don&#8217;t directly change blood pH, they have a backup argument ready to go. They say that acidic foods place stress on the body by requiring it to pull alkaline-rich minerals like calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium from the bones, teeth, and organs to buffer against the acidity. They allege this leads to osteoporosis and fatigue, and compromises our immune system, making us vulnerable to viruses and disease.</p>



<p>That claim just doesn&#8217;t hold pH 7 neutral water. Yes, that&#8217;s a great theory which if you want to apply to &#8216;acidic foods&#8217; will apply equally to &#8216;alkaline foods&#8217; so an all-alkaline diet would be just as harmful and ‘stressful’ from the need of the body to buffer the pH back into the tight range of 7.35-7.45.</p>



<p>And all this focus on blood pH pushed by alkaline diets ignores this one simple observation: pH differs throughout different body compartments. You want a very acidic stomach to help with efficient digestion. While your mouth salvia is slightly acidic at about pH 6 which is optimal for salivary amylase that helps with starch breakdown. While a lower pH in the colon from bacterial fermentation gives favourable changes in disease risk profile.</p>



<p>Then there is your skin which has a pH of about 5. Just what on earth is an alkaline diet trying to achieve by only targeting the blood?!</p>



<p>An alkaline diet &#8216;works&#8217; because it gives a person a selective list of foods to eat and avoid which means lots of fruits and vegetables (and lemon water too obviously) and less highly processed food, foods high in sugar, and alcohol. That&#8217;s it.</p>



<p>You don’t have to believe in the crazy that is the alkaline diet, spend money on alkalinised water, or squeeze a lemon into your water while needlessly cutting out otherwise healthy foods like wholegrains from your diet to make a positive change to your diet and lifestyle.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The downsides</strong></h2>



<p>Are there downsides to lemon water? The only ones of note are an effect on your tooth enamel if you’re making this a regular habit along with more stomach acid production. So consider using a straw and rinsing your mouth with plain water afterwards if this could be a concern for you and your teeth. Some people with a history of heartburn can find symptoms are aggravated by drinking lemon water, but this can be variable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What it all means</strong></h2>



<p>Lemon water can be an enjoyable and refreshing drink and an easy way to add a bit of extra vitamin C into your diet. And if you’re drinking lemon water in place of sugary drinks that could be a plus for your body weight and health. But most of the benefits attributed to lemon water are blown way out of proportion.</p>



<p>If you enjoy drinking lemon water, then drink it. Just don&#8217;t expect any magical changes in your body weight, skin or body chemistry. At least nothing that can’t be gained from drinking plenty of water throughout the day and eating an orange or two. But if you don’t like drinking it, then you’re not missing out on much at all.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/lemon-water/">Lemon water: is it worth the squeeze or just sour hype?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au">Thinking Nutrition</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Are you a food, sugar or carb addict? In this blog post, I explore if food addiction really should be seen as the same as that of a drug addiction.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/food-addiction/">Can you be addicted to food?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au">Thinking Nutrition</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Can a craving for food, especially when not hungry, really be considered an ‘addiction’? The idea of food addiction is a controversial one. When the term ‘food addiction’ is used, it usually expresses the desire for certain types of foods – normally ones that are not the healthiest of choices. Is it possible then to elevate what someone calls a &#8216;food addiction&#8217; to the same level as a drug or gambling addiction? That’s what I’ll explore in this blog post.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="800" src="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Mousetrap.png" alt="food addiction" class="wp-image-6316" srcset="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Mousetrap.png 1200w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Mousetrap-300x200.png 300w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Mousetrap-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Mousetrap-768x512.png 768w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Mousetrap-600x400.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p>Sugar addiction. Junk food addiction. Carb addiction. It seems we are in the middle of a food addiction epidemic. But everyone is addicted to food to some degree; just try going without eating for 24 hours and you’ll be craving food. But this is no different to the ‘craving’ we have for oxygen if we stay underwater for too long. Or your strong desire for water if the weather is hot and you’ve been exercising.</p>



<p>None of these examples are remotely related to addiction. They are just deep-seated physiologic needs that our body will drive us to seek. Addiction is a very different situation. Enjoying a nice meal, the company of friends or a walk on a sunny day are not addictions either &#8211; they are just pleasant things we enjoy doing. A true addiction is very different to the core needs that keep us alive and is much more than just a pleasant sensation of enjoying something.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Defining food addiction</strong></h2>



<p>The term ‘food addiction’ gets thrown around way too loosely. This isn&#8217;t helped by having no unified agreement on a clinical definition for food addiction. Food addiction is perhaps best described as a condition in which a person has the compulsion to eat certain foods despite negative consequences such as weight gain or health problems.</p>



<p>Self-described food addiction is characterised by symptoms such as cravings, loss of control when eating food, and withdrawal symptoms when the person is unable to eat the foods they desire. These symptoms don’t sit in isolation as there is a lot of overlap in the behaviours credited to food addiction and binge eating disorders.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean that food addiction and binge eating disorders are the same things. What someone may describe as a ‘food addiction’ could be on the spectrum of being closer to a binge eating disorder. So, when someone describes themselves as having a food addiction, it may just be code for a feeling of loss of control around food.</p>



<p>Someone who describes themselves as a ‘food addict’ can become dependent upon the pleasant feelings that come from consuming certain foods. This drives a constant need to eat, even when not hungry. These behaviours generate a vicious cycle. This can lead to several physical, emotional, and social consequences. Consequences such as digestive problems, heart disease, obesity, low self-esteem, depression and isolation.</p>



<p>Even though food addictions seem to be similar to binge eating disorders, food addictions are more related to eating patterns centred on pleasure and reward.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is ‘substance use disorder’ a better term?</strong></h2>



<p>Another way to define a food addiction is to consider it as falling under the wider umbrella of substance use disorders. A substance use disorder is a complex condition in which a person experiences uncontrolled use of a substance despite harmful consequences.</p>



<p>Think of things like alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs that are used to the point where the person’s ability to function in day-to-day life becomes impaired. People keep using the substance even when they know it is causing or will cause problems. The most severe substance use disorders are sometimes called addictions.</p>



<p>Rather than ‘food addiction’, a more useful term could still fall under the umbrella of a substance use disorder if you apply it to certain foods. And that was the conclusion of a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/4/477" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">systematic review</a> that explored the evidence for ‘food addiction’. Many characteristics describing food addictions had some degree of overlap with a substance use disorder. These characteristics included:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Preoccupation with the substance</li>



<li>Brain changes</li>



<li>Decreased control</li>



<li>Social harms</li>



<li>Risky use</li>



<li>Issues of tolerance and withdrawal</li>



<li>Relapse.</li>
</ul>



<p>Perhaps the biggest finding from the review was that a food addiction didn’t apply to all foods. Instead, it was certain foods, particularly highly processed foods with added sweeteners and fats, that showed the greatest addictive or ‘substance abuse’ potential.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Foods we crave the most</strong></h2>



<p>Foods rich in kilojoules, sugar, fat and salt are highly desirable. And these types of foods are most closely linked to compulsive overeating, even when a person isn’t hungry.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(18)30325-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Research studies</a> that involve scanning the brains of volunteers who have been presented with different foods have highlighted many regions of the brain that are altered in similar ways to that seen with drug use. The foods that light up these brain regions the most are high-sugar and high-fat foods. The most desirable foods have a combination of both fat and sugar.</p>



<p>The brain regions most affected typically involve those involved in the anticipation or satisfaction of a reward. The media loves to report on these types of studies involving brain scans as it allows them to run with headlines such as carbs, sugar or junk foods are as ‘addictive as cocaine’. These headlines are great for clickbait but do little to give a balanced context for what is really going on under the hood.</p>



<p>Those same reward and pleasure brain centres that are stimulated by desirable foods can also be lit up by pictures of puppies. Or by receiving a hug. We don&#8217;t consider puppies and hugs as cocaine-fuelled addictions. So, the brain research on food probably is not telling us all that much about food addiction, but instead, simply states that there are certain foods we find desirable. Everyone experiences that.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hyper-palatable foods are the issue</strong></h2>



<p>When you have a nice combination of sugar, fat or salt in highly processed foods, it can make a food hyper-palatable. ‘Hyper’ means excessive and ‘palatable’ means appetising and pleasing to the taste buds. A hyper-palatable food is so tempting it can override your ability to control the amount of it you eat. And this hyper-palatability could be a major driver of weight gain and poor health.</p>



<p>One interesting thing about foods we consider hyper-palatable is that it isn’t just the fat or sugar by themselves that are the issue. But when you combine them that is where the brain chemistry changes. Studies that have looked at brain regions involved in reward find that foods high in fat and sugar are more desirable than foods that contain only fat or sugar. Chocolate would have to be the pin-up food here for the perfect mix of sugar and fat. And we know what the desire for chocolate feels like.</p>



<p>So, when people blame carbs or sugar for their food addiction, they usually fail to mention that it is a combination of refined carbs and fat. If people really had a ‘sugar addiction’ then pure white sugar would be what they desired. But they don&#8217;t. It is the complex food matrix that contains sugar and other nutrients that make food more appealing.</p>



<p>Hyper-palatability is not just about foods high in sugar. It can be experienced in the savoury realm too. Combining salt and fat in just the right mix is a potent merger in helping to promote passive over-consumption of foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be.</p>



<p>Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is<a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/salt-promotes-overeating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""> linked with eating more kilojoules</a>, having less control over eating, and having a higher chance of being overweight. In fact, the link between over-eating food because of its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods.</p>



<p>What all this means is that when you hear the term ‘food addiction’, think instead that it is likely describing desirability for certain types of foods that are hyper-palatable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ranking the most ‘addictive’ foods</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Scientists have <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117959" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">attempted to rank</a> the most addictive foods by asking volunteers which foods they considered the most ‘addictive’. The ‘Top 10’ foods on the list have the common connection of all being highly palatable, kilojoule-dense and containing both fat and refined carbohydrates such as white flour or sugar. The list of the top 10 foods in order reads as:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Chocolate</li>



<li>Ice cream</li>



<li>French fries</li>



<li>Pizza</li>



<li>Cookies</li>



<li>Chips</li>



<li>Cake</li>



<li>Popcorn</li>



<li>Cheeseburgers</li>



<li>Muffins</li>
</ol>



<p>And at the bottom of the list, you find foods like bananas, broccoli, carrots, brown rice and beans. All very healthy foods that feature as core foods in Dietary Guidelines around the world. And all foods that rarely if ever you hear people saying they’re ‘addicted’ to.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What it all means</strong></h2>



<p>From an emotional standpoint, it certainly is possible for a person to feel addicted to food. This feeling is created by an overwhelming lack of control. But that doesn’t mean a person is addicted to food in the same way that someone may be addicted to illicit drugs, alcohol or gambling. This is not diminishing the issue of food addiction. The experience of feeling out of control around food and struggling to moderate consumption is a real experience for many people.</p>



<p>Labelling a food or nutrient as ‘addictive’ can drive unwarranted fears that can increase the risk of disordered eating. And while the types of foods that usually get labelled with the ‘addictive’ tag are the same ones we would be best eating less of, they don’t need to be cut out of someone’s diet completely. Desiring kilojoule-dense palatable foods that hit the ‘sweet spot’ of our brain is part of being human after all.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/food-addiction/">Can you be addicted to food?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au">Thinking Nutrition</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>With a rapidly ageing population, more people than ever are becoming at risk of nutritional frailty. Older age is a time when specific nutrient needs can be higher while the ability to meet those needs has greater barriers. In this blog post, I highlight how our nutrition needs change as we age, the factors that make it harder to meet these needs, and the role nutrition plays in promoting healthy ageing and improving the outlook of age-related diseases.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gym-Equipment.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="800" src="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gym-Equipment.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6278" srcset="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gym-Equipment.png 1200w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gym-Equipment-300x200.png 300w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gym-Equipment-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gym-Equipment-768x512.png 768w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gym-Equipment-600x400.png 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>



<p>The world&#8217;s population is ageing. We’re living longer and because of that comes a host of potential health problems. In Australia alone, older people comprise a considerable proportion of the population with over 1 in 7 people aged 65 and over. Compare that to almost 100 years ago when just 5 people in one hundred made it past 65 years. And future projections put the number of older adults in Australia at more than 1 in 5 in just the next 30 years. You’ll find similar trends in almost all countries.</p>



<p>With ageing and a longer life comes a variety of changes to the body. These include muscle loss, thinner skin and less stomach acid. There are also changes in our nutritional needs. Protein stands out here. It is one of the few nutrients where you see a substantial jump in <a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/nutrient-reference-values/nutrients/protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">official recommended intakes</a> once someone hits their senior years &#8211; and for good reason. More about that shortly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Barriers to good nutrition in older age</strong></h2>



<p>Having official recommendations for nutrient goals is one thing; achieving them is another. And this is where unique factors related to ageing arise that can compromise meeting nutrient needs &#8211; further exacerbating the risk of deficiencies.</p>



<p>First, there are social factors. This can include a change in housing and living situation.. Then there can be the loss of a partner and all the upheaval that can cause. And of course, changes in income going from employment to retirement can all affect someone’s living circumstances. Depression, lack of independence and social isolation are all big factors that can make food less appealing, further contributing to a less-than-ideal diet.</p>



<p>Then there are physiological factors such as a decline in health and the presence of chronic disease. For instance, atrophic gastritis which is common in adults over 50 results in stomach inflammation and a decline in factors needed for vitamin B12 absorption. Mobility issues can affect access to food and even the ability to open jars and food containers or lift heavier things in the kitchen. Poor dentition, swallowing problems and changes in taste and smell all affect the eating experience.</p>



<p>The end result of all this is a greater risk of malnutrition in seniors. Estimates point to 1 in 3 community living older people being malnourished. That number escalates when you look at hospital and institutional settings.</p>



<p>The consequences of poor nutrition in older age are severe. They include a compromised immune system, muscle weakness and decreased bone mass which can lead to falls and fractures, poor wound healing, a higher risk of hospitalisation and earlier mortality.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nutrients to watch out for</strong></h2>



<p>Some nutrients are more of a concern than others for likely not being inadequately consumed in older adults. These include protein, omega-3 fatty acids, fibre, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and the vitamins A, B6, B12, D and E.</p>



<p>Let’s take vitamin D just as one example. Vitamin D is found in only a few foods, so the sun is the major source contributing to about 80 percent of the body&#8217;s reserves. Less mobile people such as those in nursing homes are at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. This is compounded by a decline in kidney function with age as the kidneys are needed for vitamin D activation.</p>



<p>Low levels of vitamin D are associated with lower-extremity muscle weakness, impaired balance and accelerated loss of muscle mass, strength and physical function. That makes vitamin D deficiency an independent predictor of falls in older people.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32846760/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">systematic review and meta-analysis</a> of 47 randomised-controlled trials designed to reduce falls and fracture risk by vitamin D supplementation concluded that vitamin D supplementation plays an important role in reducing the risk of falls. A benefit of vitamin D on fracture risk reduction though was only seen with vitamin D and calcium supplements combined. A greater benefit with vitamin D was seen at supplement doses above 800 IU per day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why a higher body weight is better in older age</strong></h2>



<p>Excess body weight gets a big focus throughout the lifespan for its link with chronic disease. But once a person gets into their older years, that link starts to unravel.</p>



<p>Just looking at <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523050244" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">BMI at a population level in adults over 65 years of age</a> and its link to earlier mortality, there is a clear U shape to the graph. That in itself isn’t so surprising as very low and very high body weight are linked to earlier mortality. What is surprising is that the bottom of that U curve comes in at around a BMI of 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. This gives credence to current recommendations on body weight in older age that a ‘healthy’ BMI range should be higher than the normally used range of 20 to 25.</p>



<p>Why could a higher BMI be better in older age? It can be a sign of better nutrition and hence less risk of malnutrition. And that extra body fat can give some real-world padding to the body to help protect it against falls. What all of this means is that less focus should be given to excess body weight as someone gets older. There are other more important things to be concerned about: such as nutrition frailty and sarcopenia.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sarcopenia in older adults</strong></h2>



<p>Nutrition frailty is a state commonly seen in older adults. It is characterised by significant loss of weight, muscle mass and strength &#8211; making the person susceptible to disability. This is all impacted by chronic undernutrition, the presence of disease, hormonal changes and decreased physical activity. Which then leads to sarcopenia.</p>



<p>Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterised by progressive and generalised loss of muscle mass and strength. It is tightly correlated with physical disability, poor quality of life and earlier death. Ageing is a major cause of sarcopenia.</p>



<p>Sarcopenia is compounded by a decline in physical activity, a decrease in motor neuron recruitment needed to make muscles work, and a decline in anabolic hormones. All of this is underpinned by chronic inflammation.</p>



<p>The causes of sarcopenia are the absolute key reason why both resistance exercise and a high-protein diet are the cornerstones of its management and prevention. Protein recommendations of up to 1.5 grams per kilogram of body weight in older age are common now when overt sarcopenia is present. Combining that higher protein intake with resistance exercise can help to preserve and build back valuable muscle mass.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Inflammation + Ageing = Inflammageing</strong></h2>



<p>The combination of chronic disease and sarcopenia in older age gives rise to a unique descriptor of the underlying problem: and that’s a term called <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-018-0064-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">inflammageing</a>. </p>



<p>Ageing itself is characterised by chronic low-grade inflammation. Chronic inflammation increases platelet activation and blood clotting. It can also deplete the reserve of internal antioxidants, generate free radicals and amplify oxidative stress. And it will even delay wound healing and tissue regeneration and promote cell ageing and premature cell death. I’ve already done a <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/inflammation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">detailed blog post</a> on the topic of inflammation so check that out for a much wider view.</p>



<p>There is now growing evidence linking a dietary pattern ranking high in its proinflammatory potential (and here, think of a typical Western diet high in highly processed foods and low in fibre) and a greater risk of the presence of inflammation, low muscle mass, low muscle function and sarcopenia. One piece of <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/4/1166" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">research done on older Australians</a> found that a high dietary inflammatory index score was directly associated with lower lean body mass and less mobility. Mobility was assessed by a timed up-and-go test where a person from a sitting position has to stand up, walk 3 metres, turn around and walk back again. The longer it takes, the more it says about your mobility, strength and balance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Combatting inflammation</strong></h2>



<p>Diet and lifestyle choices can go a long way to treating inflammation. And for diet, what is widely considered an ‘anti-inflammatory diet’ is one high in fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, legumes, and whole grains. A <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7400632/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Mediterranean-style diet</a> would be one such variation of this, especially when you add in fish and olive oil.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t stop there. Exercise is also a potent force against chronic inflammation with a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109705004705" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">negative association</a> between physical activity levels and CRP which is a blood marker for inflammation. So exercise in older age not only helps fight sarcopenia but aids in blunting inflammation – it’s all related.</p>



<p>And then we have dietary fibre. Fibre is a top-rated fuel for our gut microbiome which is a big player in chronic inflammation, especially when you consider our gut is the home to most of our immune activity. When certain beneficial bacteria ferment fibre, they produce butyric acid. Butyric acid helps mediate the immune response, lower circulating inflammatory markers and improve the integrity of the gut barrier. Beneficial microbes also help fight off more inflammatory, gut-damaging microbes directly by suppressing their growth.</p>



<p>Simply put: the more fibre (which means more plant foods) a person eats in their diet, the lower their blood markers of inflammation are likely to be.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cognitive decline: what role for nutrition?</strong></h2>



<p>Of all the diseases linked with ageing, it would be those of cognitive decline such as Alzheimer’s disease that are the most devastating for the person and their family. There is no single cause of dementia, but one factor that is considered a culprit is oxidative stress and inflammation – yet again.</p>



<p>So can antioxidants and other types of nutritional supplements help in addressing oxidative stress? There is very mixed and inconsistent evidence that nutritional supplements such as vitamins B6, B12, C, or E; folate; or omega-3 polyunsaturated fats play a protective role when given in isolation. Yet observational evidence points to a diet containing foods high in phytonutrients offering some degree of protection.</p>



<p>The disconnect here is that antioxidants are not just one molecule; they represent a property that is part of many vitamins and minerals. And there are thousands of other chemicals that have some potential antioxidant activity and these compounds are called polyphenols. There are over 8,000 different types of polyphenols found in fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, tea and coffee.</p>



<p>A brief reading about polyphenols on the Internet will bring up article after article highlighting that polyphenols are antioxidants and that explains their health benefits. Nutrition science though has well-and-truly moved on from using such simplistic language and concepts to describe how these thousands of polyphenols found in food work. They are much more than antioxidants. Focusing only on antioxidants or a single phytonutrient is like zeroing in on a section of a painting and seeing only the dots. You need to step back and see the bigger picture. It should instead be about&nbsp;polyphenols and their multitude of benefits and actions in the body such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Regulating cell growth and death</li>



<li>Slowing down cancer cell proliferation</li>



<li>Altering glucose responses and insulin sensitivity</li>



<li>Increasing activity of enzymes involved in removing harmful substances from the body</li>



<li>Decreasing inflammation.</li>
</ul>



<p>Taken together, it strongly advocates for a food-first approach if nutrition is to have a role in halting cognitive decline, rather than taking nutrient supplements in isolation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The MIND diet</strong></h2>



<p>This leads me to just what are the characteristics of a diet that could be linked to reducing the risk of dementia. And here we have what has been termed the MIND diet which has been developed over many years out of research. And by diet here, I mean ‘way of eating’ not ‘weight loss’. MIND is an acronym for Mediterranean-DASH diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay. It combines characteristics of a Mediterranean-style diet with the DASH diet where DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. The DASH diet can lower high blood pressure which is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. And on top of this, the MIND diet also includes foods specifically relevant to brain health.</p>



<p>Here is what a MIND diet looks like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Lots of leafy green vegetables and other kinds of vegetables</li>



<li>Berries eaten at least twice a week</li>



<li>Wholegrains eaten each day</li>



<li>Fish and poultry</li>



<li>Legumes</li>



<li>Nuts</li>



<li>And to round out the Mediterranean flavour, olive oil and if you’re partial to it, some red wine.</li>
</ul>



<p>The diet also limits how much red meat and highly processed discretionary foods like sweets and fast food are eaten.</p>



<p>So far there is good observational evidence to link this type of dietary pattern with reducing the risk of cognitive decline. For example, an <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30826160/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Australian study</a> of 1,220 adults aged 60 years and over without dementia who were followed for 12 years found a 19 percent reduced odds of developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia for those people adhering closely to what a MIND diet advocates for. And this benefit was much greater than what was seen in people just following the principles of a Mediterranean-style diet alone.</p>



<p>Intervention studies with a MIND diet are now beginning to be published. Positive results were seen in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04258-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">trial of cognitive performance and brain structure</a> in healthy women who were obese. However, a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2302368" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">more recent longer-term study</a> that ran for 3 years in healthy adults with a family history of dementia failed to show a difference on cognition or brain structure in those who followed the MIND diet compared to a control group. However, in that last study, a key aspect was that the diets of both groups were designed to provide a mild level of calorie restriction meaning weight loss was seen in both groups. This could have masked direct benefits from the diet itself as both groups actually saw similar improvements in cognition over the study.</p>



<p>And final mention goes to our gut microbiota which, as you can probably guess, changes with older age, especially over the age of 80 where diet, lifestyle and other factors have the biggest impact on health. The ageing microbiota, like the ageing person, suffers from reduced resilience. And there is now <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33619379/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">some research</a> to show that there could also be a healthy microbiome fingerprint linked to improved health and longevity, though this is certainly a very nascent area.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What it all means</strong></h2>



<p>Some aspects of ageing may be inevitable, but the risk of specific age-related diseases and disability may, in part, be modified by dietary choices. This means that nutrition becomes even more important in older age when you consider how many barriers can arise to eating well.</p>



<p>Two of the most important aspects of ageing well come from regular resistance exercise and meeting a higher goal for protein which together can help fight against age-related loss of muscle mass. Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that a variant around the theme of a Mediterranean-style diet that is high in fruit (especially berries), nuts, legumes, fish and vegetables may reduce the risk of both mild cognitive impairment and dementia along with improving gut microbiota health. The theme of this style of eating can be adapted to any person’s dietary preferences or cultural background and is not a way of eating that should be changed to in older age, but instead to be adopted earlier in life.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/nutrition-for-healthy-ageing/">Nutrition for healthy ageing: combating sarcopenia and inflammageing</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au">Thinking Nutrition</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Move aside coconut oil, your time in the superfood spotlight has passed. Today it is all about apple cider vinegar.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Apple-cider-vinegar.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Apple-cider-vinegar-1024x683.png" alt="apple cider vinegar" class="wp-image-6261" srcset="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Apple-cider-vinegar-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Apple-cider-vinegar-300x200.png 300w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Apple-cider-vinegar-768x512.png 768w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Apple-cider-vinegar-600x400.png 600w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Apple-cider-vinegar.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Apple cider vinegar is one of the latest additions to the superfood revolving door family. But there is nothing new under the sun about apple cider vinegar: it has been an ingredient in folk medicine for centuries.</p>



<p>Let’s take a step back first and talk about vinegar in general. What you’re getting in apple cider vinegar is just a dilute form of good old acetic acid – that’s vinegar in the common tongue. Vinegar is made by fermenting alcohol or sugar in the presence of acetic acid bacteria. Any flavouring or colouring in the vinegar will come from the food source of it. And that food source can range from all sorts of things such as rice, wholegrains, grapes, alcohol or….apples.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How apple cider vinegar is made</strong></h2>



<p>To make apple cider vinegar, the apples are chopped up, covered with water and left until the natural sugar ferments and makes ethanol. The second stage is when acetic acid bacteria convert the ethanol into acetic acid.</p>



<p>And there you have it: apple cider vinegar. There is nothing that special about this process as it can be repeated with dozens of different foods.</p>



<p>Apple cider vinegar has a distinctive cloudy brown colour due to it being unstrained and containing strands of material called &#8220;the mother&#8221;. The mother is a mixture of proteins, yeast and bacteria that look a bit like cobwebs floating in the liquid.</p>



<p>Many people attribute apple cider vinegar’s proposed health effects to the mother. And there is a plausible reason for this as the mother could be a potential probiotic. But, the importance of the mother as a probiotic doesn’t have a lot of research studies to back it up at this time.</p>



<p>So, if I left the story here, it would just be a nice tale about a condiment you may care to keep in your pantry and which you can make some pretty zesty salad dressings with.</p>



<p>But enter the Internet. A Google search for apple cider vinegar reveals all sorts of amazing health claims: from cutting your risk of cancer to even getting rid of dandruff. But the most common claims centre around its benefit for weight loss and controlling blood sugars. So, let’s delve into those ones. And spoiler alert: they are the only ones that have even a skerrick of science behind them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Apple cider vinegar the fat blaster</strong></h2>



<p>The claim that a shot of apple cider vinegar will melt away body fat surprisingly does have a very small amount of scientific evidence behind it. Albeit from just two human clinical trials.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bbb/73/8/73_90231/_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">2009 study</a> from Japan showed that a group of overweight men and women who took two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar each day for 12 weeks saw a small benefit on body weight of just under 2 kilograms. While waist circumference and blood triglycerides fell too compared to people who weren’t drinking apple cider vinegar.</p>



<p>A more <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1756464618300483" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">recent study</a> randomly assigned 39 people to follow a restricted-calorie diet with or without apple cider vinegar for 12 weeks.&nbsp; While both groups lost weight, the apple cider vinegar group did lose a bit more: by a bit under 2 kilograms.</p>



<p>These two studies are certainly interesting, but was it thanks to the metabolic miracle that is apple cider vinegar? Most likely no.</p>



<p>There have been several taste studies finding that drinking vinegar can induce a slight feeling of nausea and a lessening of appetite. That is hardly surprising. That does not in any way negate that apple cider vinegar may have a small benefit on weight loss. But the mechanism here is probably making a person feel a little ill and reducing their appetite. You can drink plain old private-label supermarket vinegar and get the same results if you want to.</p>



<p>Not to discount other benefits, there could be an advantage for weight loss by regulating blood sugar levels which is an interesting area I’ll explore next.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Keeping your blood sugar in check</strong></h2>



<p>Another claim that is hard to miss is that apple cider vinegar will reduce blood sugar and insulin levels. This is a rare situation where there is actually some reasonable evidence to support the claim. But spoiler alert: it is nothing miraculous to do with apple cider vinegar: it’s related to the acetic acid, for which any vinegar will do the trick.</p>



<p>Way back in 1987, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00021369.1988.10868833" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Japanese researchers</a> found that giving a small group of healthy volunteers vinegar containing 5 percent acetic acid could blunt the rise in blood glucose after having a dose of sucrose on an empty stomach. Likewise, another <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1602197" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">small study in 2005</a> found that different levels of acetic acid could also blunt blood glucose and insulin responses in healthy volunteers after a meal of white bread while also increasing feelings of fullness.</p>



<p>There have been other studies in this area too, and the sum of the findings was included in a <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168-8227(16)30851-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">systematic review</a> published in 2017. And the conclusion? The pooled analysis of studies revealed a significant reduction in glucose and insulin in people who consumed vinegar compared with a control group. Note here though that there is no mention of ‘apple cider vinegar’ in the research. It was just generic vinegar that it relates to, which of course apple cider vinegar falls under the umbrella of because of its acetic acid content.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Apple cider vinegar for diabetes?</strong></h2>



<p>Most of the research in the area of blood glucose regulation has been done with healthy volunteers, but there have been some small studies in people with type 2 diabetes. And here, it seems there is also a small benefit on blood sugars with improved fasting blood glucose levels.</p>



<p>Vinegar may help facilitate the production of hormones involved in glucose regulation, reduce the activity of carbohydrate-digesting enzymes, improve insulin sensitivity and even increase blood flow to tissues. But a key point is that the benefit of vinegar seems to apply to meals that contain starch mostly &#8211; it will do very little for high-fat meals.</p>



<p>So, does this mean everyone should be drinking vinegar shots with their meals? No. If you don’t have diabetes, your blood glucose is regulated just fine. But if you do have type 2 diabetes, there is likely not as great a benefit. That&#8217;s because the underlying condition is already a symptom of impaired glucose regulation and insulin resistance. So vinegar can’t overcome all of that. But you absolutely must talk to your doctor if you are considering trialling apple cider vinegar for diabetes especially if you are taking medications to help treat diabetes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What else can it do?</strong></h2>



<p>What about all those other health claims you may have read about for apple cider vinegar? Just about all of them are not supported by much evidence nor is there any strong reason why apple cider vinegar should even give these benefits over and above any other type of mild acid.</p>



<p>Because of apple cider vinegar&#8217;s antimicrobial properties (albeit fairly weak compared to well-established disinfection agents), it is often suggested as a natural cleaner for the home. And yes, it will do the job as a cleaner as the acid is effective against mould. But so are salt, lemon juice, hydrogen peroxide, tea tree oil and baking soda.</p>



<p>Apple cider vinegar because of its low pH works great against alkaline grime such as hard water and mineral deposits as well as soap scum. But again here, supermarket private-label vinegar will work just as well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taking the smile from your dial</strong></h2>



<p>Dubious and reasonably well-supported health claims aside, there is a pretty compelling  reason <em>not</em> to be taking apple cider vinegar as a daily health tonic.</p>



<p>Apple cider vinegar has a pH of around 3, so it can dissolve the tooth structure when it comes into contact with teeth. If the erosion is severe, this can lead to the need for extensive and expensive dental care. And the risk is not just a theoretical one, because in at least<a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/jmf.2020.0108" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""> one clinical trial with vinegar</a>, it monitored dental erosion over 8 weeks. And erosion increased by 18 percent in those taking a daily shot of vinegar.</p>



<p>If you still want to take a daily shot of apple cider vinegar as a health tonic (or any other type of vinegar), please dilute it first.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What it all means</strong></h2>



<p>Apart from it making a nice salad dressing or even a handy all-purpose domestic cleaning agent, there aren&#8217;t that many compelling health reasons to be taking apple cider vinegar. But at least some of the claims about it have some evidence behind them &#8211; albeit they relate to any form of generic vinegar, rather than anything special about one made from apples. So perhaps ask yourself if any of it is worth it if it means taking a shot of apple cider with each of your meals.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/apple-cider-vinegar-miracle-elixir-or-marketing-mirage/">Apple cider vinegar: miracle elixir or marketing mirage?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au">Thinking Nutrition</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>To exercise fasted or fed? It’s a controversial topic with strong views coming from both camps. Exercising in a fasted state is frequently endorsed as an essential criterion for those promoting weight loss to ensure the most ‘fat burning’ possible. Then there is the opposing view that you want to be well-fuelled before exercise so you can power the length and duration of your exercise. But the simple logic of both camps gets muddied when you consider the complexity of physiology and psychology of us as human beings. In this blog post, I’ll look at the fasted versus fed exercise debate.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Exercise-Fasted-or-Fed.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Exercise-Fasted-or-Fed-1024x683.png" alt="exercise fasted or fed" class="wp-image-6238" srcset="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Exercise-Fasted-or-Fed-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Exercise-Fasted-or-Fed-300x200.png 300w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Exercise-Fasted-or-Fed-768x512.png 768w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Exercise-Fasted-or-Fed-600x400.png 600w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Exercise-Fasted-or-Fed.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>We exercise for all sorts of reasons. General health and fitness, training for competitive sport or to help shed a few kilos are all common reasons. I&#8217;ll dive straight into that last point first. If your aim is to lose weight, then are you better off exercising on an empty stomach?</p>



<p>It is a seductive idea about weight loss: you want to ensure all that sweat is using up your body’s fat stores to fuel its endeavours rather than grinding your gears and going nowhere because you’re metabolising the meal you just ate before exercise. But what is really going on?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fat burning 101</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s take a step back first and talk about ‘fat burning’ in general. Well-meaning advice claims that you need to exercise at a low-to-moderate level of intensity to burn fat.</p>



<p>Now yes, it is true that the body burns the greatest <em>percentage</em> of fat at lower intensities of aerobic exercise. But at higher intensities, you burn far more kilojoules – and more fat kilojoules &#8211; overall.</p>



<p>If you were only concerned about burning the greatest <em>percentage</em> of kilojoules from fat, then sleeping is where it is at, but the total energy cost of this is tiny. Low-intensity workouts do promote weight and fat loss; you just have to do them for a longer time.</p>



<p>When time is limited to exercise, then it makes sense to work as hard as you safely can to get the most health, performance and weight loss gains from it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fed or fasted?</strong></h2>



<p>So if we take it that it is the intensity and duration that matter most for long-term weight balance, what about the follow-up question of whether being fed or fasted makes a difference when you exercise?</p>



<p>Doing cardio exercise does increase fat oxidation and it seems that people who do this in a fasted state oxidise more fat than glucose. But this doesn’t translate into increased body fat loss all things being equal when comparing it to a similar situation when doing the exercise fed. Why should this be the case?</p>



<p>The key is that short-term transient spikes in fat oxidation are pretty meaningless. It’s the long-term balance over days and weeks that will dictate whether you lose or gain body fat. So, if you exercise fasted and experience a small spike in fat burning, it is offset by the ‘delayed gratification’ that you’re just shifting what you would have eaten before exercise to later on. Meaning you would be in a state of energy excess at that time.</p>



<p>Now, for the person who exercises fed, sure, they may experience less fat oxidation during exercise, but the energy deficit will be delayed as they won’t be eating as much later on.</p>



<p>Again, remember I said here that all things being equal in that our fed and fasted exercise scenarios both involved the person eating the same amount of food over the course of the day.</p>



<p>That’s your theory done, so let&#8217;s delve into what the actual science and clinical research studies have to say.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Clinical trials have the answer</strong></h2>



<p>A <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5142/2/4/43" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">2017 systematic review and meta-analysis</a> looked at the effect of overnight fasting before exercise compared to eating just before exercise and how this affected weight loss and body composition. And while only five studies could be included in the review, the conclusion was that performing exercise in a fasted state did not influence weight loss or changes in lean and fat mass compared to exercising in a fed state.</p>



<p>The findings from this review support the notion that weight loss and fat loss from exercise are more likely to be enhanced through creating a meaningful caloric deficit over time, rather than exercising in fasted or fed states.</p>



<p>What about exercise performance when fasted though, is it impaired? A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sms.13054" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">2018 systematic review and meta-analysis</a> looking at fed versus fasted cardio found no difference in exercise performance when workouts lasted less than an hour. But the situation was different when workouts went for more than an hour and this is where eating before the workout improved performance.</p>



<p>I want to stress that the findings from these reviews represent the average of many individuals. There are always lots of inter-individual differences. But as far as blanket population advice goes, there is no strong reason to recommend someone exercise fasted or fed when it comes to performance or weight loss goals when we’re only talking about an hour or so of exercise.</p>



<p>Go with what your body tells you. I’m a morning runner and really struggle to run with food in my stomach – I just feel sluggish for it so whether it’s psychological or physiological, I just feel better running on an empty stomach. Others need to eat before exercise as they feel their blood sugar falling and experience a lack of energy.</p>



<p>So, whether you train fasted or fed comes down to personal preference and scheduling. If you feel you need to eat before exercise and it sits well with you, then eat. Do you prefer or enjoy training fasted? Then train fasted.</p>



<p>As a disclaimer though, if you’re planning a serious endurance session for more than an hour or your goal is to perform or hit maximal effort, you may want to consider taking on some food before you train. For exercise under an hour in duration or if it is a low-intensity training session, eating before will make little difference unless you just feel better in your mind for it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The case for intermittent fasting</strong></h2>



<p>Another extension on the question of exercising in a fasted state is how it applies to<a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/intermittent-fasting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""> intermittent fasting</a>. On the surface, some of the principles of intermittent fasting do seem to go against the core sports nutrition concepts of refuelling post-exercise and spreading food consumption (especially protein) over the day.</p>



<p>But in fact, there could be some benefits from ‘<a href="https://www.mysportscience.com/post/2015/07/13/6-ways-to-trainlow" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">training low</a>’. These are times when carbohydrate especially is limited to promote favourable aspects of metabolic fat adaptation. Periods of ‘training low’ are then offset by times of ‘training high’ for high-quality sessions and race days where peak performance is needed and where you would revert back to standard feeding regimens. So, intermittent fasting could fit within this type of protocol if it was periodised.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/1/168" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">systematic review</a> published in 2024 on this very topic of intermittent fasting and athletic performance concluded that intermittent fasting provides benefits in terms of body composition without reducing physical performance, maintenance of lean mass, and improvements in maximum power. But everyone’s mileage is different here and your own performance would be the best guide. This is separate though to using intermittent fasting for weight loss to help improve the power-to-weight ratio in a sport where a performance benefit would be likely, but intermittent fasting is just one in a long line of ways to achieve weight loss.</p>



<p>If you’ve consistently trained in a fasted state, the metabolic and muscle adaptations you’ll acquire will boost performance when you compete in a fed state. And that’s everything, isn’t it? A fasted workout trains you to perform under difficult physiological conditions of low fuel availability and that comes in handy. You probably wouldn’t want to enter a race or powerlifting competition in a fasted state, but the fasted workouts you did in the months leading up to the competition make you more likely to perform better in a fed state.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What it all means</strong></h2>



<p>Fasted training isn’t superior to fed training if your goal is weight loss. If you enjoy training fasted or your schedule only permits training early in the morning, then train fasted. There’s very little difference between cardio in the fed or fasted state with regards to fat loss, muscle preservation, daily caloric intake or metabolic rate.</p>



<p>What really matters, then, is you. Some people feel lighter and more energised when they do cardio on an empty stomach, while others feel light-headed and sluggish. Fed or fasted state? Go for whichever makes you feel better.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/exercise-fasted-or-fed/">Is it better to exercise fasted or fed?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au">Thinking Nutrition</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The protein powder supplement market is big business. Popular in the world of sport where muscle growth is prized, the marketplace is dominated by glossy pictures of cut models and an ever-expanding list of claims for how these supplements will pack on the muscle. So, do the gym bros have it right when they say that you need these supplements if you’re serious about the gainz? Or could plain old boring ‘food’ do the same job? In this post, I dig deeper into the world of protein and muscle growth and see what the research has to say about protein supplements.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Protein-Supplements.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Protein-Supplements-1024x683.png" alt="protein supplments for muscle gainz" class="wp-image-6218" srcset="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Protein-Supplements-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Protein-Supplements-300x200.png 300w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Protein-Supplements-768x512.png 768w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Protein-Supplements-600x400.png 600w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Protein-Supplements.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>The protein and amino acid supplement market is big business. Bars, shakes, giant tubs of powder and specialist amino acid supplements dominate supplement shelves. All in the name of bigger and stronger muscles.</p>



<p>No athlete would dispute that more muscle is an advantage in sports. Dietary protein is the source of the amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. With a strength training stimulus and adequate dietary protein, new muscle protein synthesis is the result. But is there a role for extra protein through the use of supplements to get even more muscle growth and strength gains?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is more protein better?</strong></h2>



<p>To answer this question, let’s first explore how much protein sportspeople need. Consensus position statements such as those produced by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250116033654/https://www.acsm.org/docs/default-source/files-for-resource-library/protein-intake-for-optimal-muscle-maintenance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">American College of Sports Medicine</a> give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. The <a href="https://www.ausport.gov.au/ais/nutrition/supplements/group_a/sports-foods2/isolated-protein-supplement2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Australian Institute of Sport</a> also gives a similar range of 1.2 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.</p>



<p>Higher r<a href="https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijsnem/28/2/article-p170.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">ecommendation ranges</a> can sometimes be seen of 1.6 to 2.4 grams per kilogram of body weight, but this is for athletes who are on weight loss programs and are trying to add or maintain muscle bulk while losing weight at the same time.</p>



<p>The top end range of 1.7 grams per kilogram of body weight though is for elite endurance athletes, athletes in strength and power sports and those in the early stages of a strength training phase as they ramp up their gym training. The ‘recreational athlete’, which describes the vast majority of active sportspeople, only needs to aim for the bottom end of the range which is around 1.2 grams per kilogram. Which as a <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/health-conditions-and-risks/food-and-nutrients/latest-release">fun</a><a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/health-conditions-and-risks/food-and-nutrients/latest-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""> </a><a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/health-conditions-and-risks/food-and-nutrients/latest-release">fact</a>, is the average amount of protein a typical Australian adult eats each day just from their regular diet &#8211; no protein supplements required.</p>



<p>Sportspeople are more focused on protein in their diet than the average person. So just how much protein do you think they would get from their normal diet on average? Dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders.</p>



<p>But is there much benefit to eating protein above the upper limit range? If there is, it is hard to see a difference in clinical trials. This <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/6/376.long" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">2017 meta-analysis</a> of 49 studies looking at protein supplementation in resistance exercise training found that as protein intake goes up, so too does muscle strength and size. But this maxed out at 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The case for protein supplements</strong></h2>



<p>Before you think there’s ‘nothing to see here’ when it comes to protein supplements, they can’t be dismissed completely. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes.</p>



<p>When travelling, or during an intense training schedule where it is difficult to access, prepare and consume adequate food as proper meals can all be situations where it is convenient and practical to reach for a ready-to-drink protein supplement.</p>



<p>And then there is the case of athletes trying to drop weight on energy-restricted diets. They may find it harder to meet protein requirements so a protein supplement could be of use. Under energy-restricted conditions, a greater proportion of amino acids are used for energy production, resulting in fewer amino acids available for muscle growth so the idea to supplement with protein has merit.</p>



<p>While the research in this area is not as mature, for athletes trying to drop weight and wanting to maintain and promote lean body mass, protein goals of well into the 2 grams per kilogram of body weight range could be considered. At these sorts of numbers, protein supplements enter the game.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Getting your timing right</strong></h2>



<p>Moving on from daily protein requirements, is there merit to the notion of optimising muscle growth through the timing of protein consumption?</p>



<p>Optimal muscle growth and recovery is more than about meeting daily protein needs. And this is where the concept of protein timing around exercise has some credence. Each time protein is eaten, there is a small spike in muscle synthesis with a ‘dose’ of about 20 to 25 grams of high-quality protein sufficient to stimulate muscle protein synthesis following resistance exercise.</p>



<p>Having these protein ‘doses’ spread throughout the day can help to maximise exercise-induced muscular growth and aid the repair of damaged tissue. Eating quantities of protein above this 20 to 25 gram range in one sitting offers only a limited additional benefit with a very minor 10 percent further protein synthesis when the amount is doubled to 40 grams.</p>



<p>Despite the common recommendation to consume protein as soon as possible post-exercise, evidence-based support for this practice is lacking. That doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t be done. Only that it shouldn’t be treated as Gospel despite what the bros at the gym may tell you.</p>



<p>How long the mythical ‘post-exercise muscle anabolism’ window remains open for is still hotly debated. But it likely exists for several hours. So, fear not gym goers, your muscle gains aren’t going to evaporate because you didn’t chug down your protein shake within five minutes of your last set of bench presses.</p>



<p>There was a nice <a href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-10-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">review paper</a> on the topic of protein timing published in 2013 which is well worth reading if you want to know more about this area. Combining all the protein timing research leads to the conclusion that the body likely responds best to regular small ‘doses’ of protein throughout the day. I like to call this new muscle growth optimisation protocol “regular meals and snacks with a focus on higher-protein foods”. Others may just call it eating.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ausport.gov.au/ais/nutrition/supplements/group_a/sports-foods2/isolated-protein-supplement2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">AIS frames this advice</a> by encouraging athletes to include a small serving of protein-rich foods on 3 to 5 eating occasions each day. Targets of 0.3 to&nbsp; 0.4 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per meal or snack would equate to 15 to 30 grams of protein at each meal or snack.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wheying in on protein form</strong></h2>



<p>So that’s dose and timing covered off. What about the form of protein that is best to consume? Not all protein sources are created equal due to their amino acid composition and how quickly they are digested and absorbed. In the field of sports nutrition research, it’s dairy proteins that receive much of the attention.</p>



<p>The two main proteins in dairy are casein and whey. They are digested and absorbed at different rates, with whey getting into the bloodstream faster than casein. Most protein supplements are based on whey, but that’s more due to convenience because of its ready availability: it’s a waste product from cheese manufacturing after all.</p>



<p>Whey protein is of particular interest because it appears to have a stronger anabolic effect on muscle growth. That&#8217;s because of its higher content of a specific essential amino acid called leucine. Leucine is a branched-chain amino acid that has attracted interest for its ability to build muscles and activate a protein known as <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article-abstract/65/3/122/1847499" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">mTOR</a>, which triggers muscle protein synthesis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Plant proteins power muscle gains too</strong></h2>



<p>With a growing interest in vegetarian diets, soy protein is also a popular option. Soy is a high-biological-value protein that is rapidly digested. It comes as both a soy concentrate and soy isolate. While the balance of research indicates that whey protein may have a small edge for muscle building, some studies have found soy foods to be just as effective as whey protein in terms of their ability to promote gains in lean muscle mass.</p>



<p>One <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1997115/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">study</a>, for example, found daily supplementation of 50 grams of soy, whey, or a soy-whey protein blend in 20 male athletes engaging in a weight-training program all resulted in similar increases in lean body mass and did not negatively affect testosterone or estrogen levels.</p>



<p>Then there was this<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10687132/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""> systematic review</a> published in 2023 looking at soy protein in muscle adaptations. Soy protein could be seen to increase lean mass during resistance training similar to whey protein. This shows that soy protein can be as effective as whey protein in building lean muscle mass especially if the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/11/3871" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">leucine content of the diet </a>is matched.</p>



<p>Pea protein is another protein powder that is growing in popularity among vegetarians and people with allergies or sensitivities to dairy or eggs. Pea protein is not absorbed as fast as whey protein but is absorbed quicker than casein protein.</p>



<p>There hasn’t been a lot of research into the muscle-building properties of pea protein, but at least <a href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-014-0064-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">one 12-week study</a> involving 161 men doing resistance training who took either 50 grams of pea protein, whey protein or a placebo non-protein powder each day saw similar increases in muscle thickness between the pea and the whey protein groups. And both groups had superior gains to the placebo group so there could be something to the pea protein story here.</p>



<p>Even studies that use lower-quality protein such as that derived from wheat can elicit a significant muscle protein synthesis response if greater amounts of it are consumed. So this may be an effective strategy to compensate for its lower protein quality.</p>



<p>The story here is that adequate protein in the diet mostly trumps the source of protein &#8211; so long as the diet is varied. A variety of foods means a variety of different protein types.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the downsides?</strong></h2>



<p>So what about the downside of protein supplements? Outside of cost, there can be some negatives. For a start, they can move the focus away from the undisputed benefits of a varied training diet.</p>



<p>Purified protein preparations contain few of the other nutrients needed to support the building of muscle, and the protein they supply is usually not needed by athletes who eat food as they’re likely already meeting their requirements. The supplements then become excess protein which the body dismantles and uses for energy or stores as body fat.</p>



<p>Excess protein does not harm the kidneys in healthy people, but it has been linked to worsening pre-existing damage so it is something to be aware of if this could be you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What it all means</strong></h2>



<p>For sports people, here’s what you need to know about protein: to maximise muscle growth with resistance exercise, daily protein recommendations sit at the upper end of about 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight. Most people, especially the recreationally active, need less than this.</p>



<p>Protein goals are best achieved by spacing protein-containing meals and snacks throughout the day and aiming for 15 to 30 grams of protein at each eating occasion. There can be some cases when protein supplements make it more convenient to hit this goal, but these are the exceptions, rather than the norm. If you think it is hard for you to hit your protein goals, maybe look at your diet first before you reach for the protein supplement.</p>



<p>But the biggest performance gains in sport don’t come from protein supplements. They come from the triad of a broad varied diet, adequate rest and recovery, and the one supplement that all athletes need to be taking: it’s called BHW. Bloody hard work.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/protein-supplements-for-muscle-gainz/">From bro science to real science: navigating the protein supplement maze for maximum gainz</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au">Thinking Nutrition</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The post <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/caffeine-coffee-conception-pregnancy/">Caffeine and conception: navigating the coffee in pregnancy dilemma</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au">Thinking Nutrition</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Coffee is one of the most popular and safest stimulants that we consume. But during pregnancy, and potentially even when planning a pregnancy, it is one ‘legal drug’ where advice for women becomes a little more prescriptive. Alcohol, soft cheeses, raw fish and even raw sprouts are all foods that are best to limit or avoid during pregnancy. So, should coffee be added to the list and if so, how much is a safe amount to drink? That&#8217;s what I’ll dive into in this blog post.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Coffee-and-Pregnancy.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Coffee-and-Pregnancy-1024x640.jpg" alt="caffeine coffee pregnancy conception" class="wp-image-6188" srcset="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Coffee-and-Pregnancy-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Coffee-and-Pregnancy-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Coffee-and-Pregnancy-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Coffee-and-Pregnancy.jpg 1280w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Brew, java, black gold or go juice. Whatever you call it, coffee is the world&#8217;s second most popular beverage after tea. It has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">estimated</a> that over 2.2 billion cups of coffee are drunk every day.</p>



<p>So what’s in your daily caffeine hit? Coffee contains several useful nutrients. These include riboflavin, niacin, potassium, magnesium, various antioxidants, and many other natural plant chemicals. One <a href="https://phys.org/news/2005-08-coffee-source-antioxidants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">estimate</a> puts coffee as providing more antioxidants in a typical United States diet than the average person gets from their fairly minimal consumption of fruits and vegetables combined.</p>



<p>But any talk about coffee needs to profile the star of the show: caffeine.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Caffeine in your body</strong></h2>



<p>Caffeine is the most widely used psychoactive substance in the world. And I’m talking about both legal and illegal substances here. In Western society, 80 percent of the adult population consumes caffeine in amounts large enough to affect the brain.&nbsp;Soft drinks, tea and chocolate all contain caffeine, but coffee is the biggest source.</p>



<p>In your brain, caffeine blocks the function of an inhibitory neurotransmitter called adenosine. By blocking adenosine, caffeine increases brain activity and releases other neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine. This reduces tiredness and makes you feel more alert.</p>



<p>This all means that caffeine can lead to a short-term boost in brain function and mood, lower reaction time, increase vigilance and improve general cognitive function.</p>



<p>There are a surprising number of health benefits linked to regular coffee drinking: from a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes right through to even helping people struggling with mobility issues from Parkinson’s disease. I won’t go into the full story here, but you can read the <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/coffee-health-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">blog post</a> I wrote on this topic for the full low down on the surprising health benefits of coffee.</p>



<p>But for this post, I want to narrow in on one specific question: could your daily coffee habit be hurting your chances of conceiving or even harming a developing foetus?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Caffeine and conceiving</strong></h2>



<p>I’ll start with the good news straight off the bat: if you are trying to conceive, then there is no need to go cold turkey on caffeine. But I do need to make a disclaimer that it is certainly wise and recommended to keep your coffee habit down to the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day. Let me explain why.</p>



<p>Cutting back on caffeine is common fertility advice given to women who are struggling to conceive or going through IVF. So, are there good grounds for this advice? If you go digging into the scientific research, you’ll find mixed messages. Some studies do find a link between caffeine and a woman&#8217;s ability to conceive, while others find that it has no impact. However, the quality of the research studies here are not the greatest.</p>



<p>A link between caffeine and fertility is plausible because caffeine is known to have <a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(23)02654-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">effects on ovulation and hormone</a> levels.</p>



<p>Another interesting theory is that caffeine can affect how the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21615388/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">muscles in the fallopian tubes</a> work. These muscles contract in smooth, rhythmic waves to help the egg on its way to the uterus. Caffeine could disrupt this movement and affect the journey of the egg to its destination.</p>



<p>The experts conclude that there just isn&#8217;t enough evidence to make a definitive conclusion about caffeine and fertility. But it is worth paying heed to the possibility and keeping your coffee habit dialled back when trying to conceive.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Caffeine and IVF</strong></h2>



<p>Advice about caffeine also applies to women undergoing IVF. One <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(19)30287-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">study</a> from Denmark that looked at almost 1,700 women undergoing IVF at a large fertility clinic found that women who drank up to 5 cups of coffee had similar pregnancy success compared to women who drank no coffee.</p>



<p>Although <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5733907/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">previous work</a> from this same research group did find that drinking more than five cups of coffee a day was linked to a lower chance of conception and having a live birth.</p>



<p>So here for women undergoing IVF as well, conservative advice about keeping your coffee drinking to a couple of cups per day seems sensible.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31043232/"></a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coffee during pregnancy: yes or no?</strong></h2>



<p>So that’s the story about conception and caffeine. But once a woman is pregnant, the advice about caffeine becomes much stronger &#8211; and for good reason. A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29276412/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">systematic review and meta-analysis</a> from 2017 found a 37 percent higher risk of miscarriage in women who consumed more than 300 milligrams of caffeine a day. And the risk of miscarriage more than doubled with daily caffeine intakes above 600 milligrams.</p>



<p>Yet <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a2332" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">more research</a> has also found that for women having more than 300 milligrams of caffeine each day during pregnancy, it is linked to foetal growth restriction which could result in low birth weight.</p>



<p>On a positive note at least, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691517301709?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">major review </a>on the adverse effects of caffeine on healthy adults, pregnant women, adolescents and children from 2017 found that for women who are pregnant, up to 300 milligrams of caffeine a day is considered safe. For non-pregnant adults, the safe limit goes up to 400 milligrams per day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How much is too much?</strong></h2>



<p>None of the research I’ve profiled is new or surprising. A link between caffeine and the risk of miscarriage has been known for some time. Which is why <a href="https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/prevention-of-foodborne-illness/caffeine" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Food Standards Australia and New Zealand</a> recommend that for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, daily caffeine consumption should not exceed 200 milligrams (that’s about two cups of coffee). The same advice is mirrored by European and US regulatory bodies that advise that during pregnancy, no more than 200 milligrams of caffeine should be consumed per day.</p>



<p>Exactly why too much caffeine could be an issue during pregnancy is likely because a woman&#8217;s ability to metabolise caffeine slows during pregnancy. What&#8217;s more, caffeine readily passes from the placenta to the growing baby which is not developed enough to inactivate it. So caffeine can accumulate in the baby&#8217;s body and brain and have a real development effect.</p>



<p>The advice on caffeine during pregnancy I’ve given from peak health bodies could be subject to revision in the future as more research becomes available. Some <a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/experts-conflicted-on-controversial-caffeine-pregn" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">experts in the medical community argue</a> that because there is a dose-dependent relationship between caffeine and pregnancy risk, it indicates that even lower doses below 200 milligrams per day could have an effect during pregnancy. So according to some experts, the recommendations for a safe threshold level should be lowered even further. Some even argue that women who are pregnant or trying to conceive should avoid caffeine altogether.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Where do you find caffeine?</strong></h2>



<p>Quite rightly we associate coffee with caffeine, but find caffeine in a range of drinks and foods. So, it is good to be aware of where it may lurk if you’re keeping an eye on a 200 milligrams per day limit.</p>



<p>Sources like tea, cola soft drinks, energy drinks, chocolate and coffee ice cream can all contain caffeine. Caffeine also shows up in herbal products and over-the-counter drugs, including some headache, cold, and allergy remedies. So read labels carefully.</p>



<p>As a rough guide, a can of an energy drink like Red Bull or V has 80 milligrams of caffeine. Black and green tea have about 50 milligrams while cola drinks have 35 milligrams in a 375 mL can. If you enjoy dark chocolate, then you’ll find about 40 milligrams of caffeine in a 50-gram serve.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cutting your caffeine habit</strong></h2>



<p>If you have plans to conceive soon and your daily coffee ritual amounts to a lot more than two cups a day, then time is on your side to make the transition easier and minimise some of the withdrawal symptoms such as fatigue and headaches.</p>



<p>You might want to start by switching to a drink that’s half regular brew and half decaf. Or reduce the caffeine in homemade beverages by watering them down or brewing them for a shorter time. If you love to start your day with a cup of black tea, steeping your tea bag for one minute instead of five cuts the caffeine by as much as half.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What it all means</strong></h2>



<p>Coffee at this stage is not on the avoid list during pregnancy or when planning pregnancy. But there is enough evidence to support the case that for a short time in her life, a woman should make a concerted effort to keep her coffee habit in check.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/caffeine-coffee-conception-pregnancy/">Caffeine and conception: navigating the coffee in pregnancy dilemma</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au">Thinking Nutrition</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>What if I told you that all it takes to lose weight, boost energy and prevent diseases like arthritis, osteoporosis and cancer is to eat the right foods to keep the pH of your body in the alkaline zone? Well, if I were prepared to throw out every bit of scientific knowledge that I have on how the human body works to buffer against acidity and alkalinity then sure, I could tell you that. But I’m not. Instead, in this blog post, I’m going to investigate those wild health claims made by the celebrity-endorsed alkaline diet and explain why it is pseudoscience squared.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Alkaline-Diet.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Alkaline-Diet-1024x683.png" alt="alkaline diet" class="wp-image-6162" srcset="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Alkaline-Diet-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Alkaline-Diet-300x200.png 300w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Alkaline-Diet-768x512.png 768w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Alkaline-Diet-600x400.png 600w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Alkaline-Diet.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>The alkaline diet and all things related to ‘alkalinising’ your body has been a trend that has bubbled away for decades and shows no signs of abating. It seems any Insta influencer who isn’t promoting the merits of alkalising your body just isn’t healthing hard enough.</p>



<p>The modern popularity of the diet can be traced back to best-selling books from the early 2000s written by Robert O. Young &#8211; an American naturopathic practitioner. The most well-known was titled <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/pH-Miracle-Balance-Reclaim-Health/dp/0446536199" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">The pH Miracle</a></em> which has sold more than four million copies worldwide.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Foods to eat and avoid because….pH</strong></h2>



<p>Alkaline diets are promoted as a magical cure-all to treat or prevent cancer, heart disease, low energy levels, and a whole host of other illnesses. The premise behind the whole alkaline trend is related to something called the acid-ash hypothesis.</p>



<p>It goes like this: when we eat certain foods like meat, poultry, cheese, fish, eggs, and grains, a type of metabolic waste residue which is called an ‘ash’ is produced. &nbsp;This metabolic waste can be alkaline, neutral, or acidic. Now, this isn’t quite the same as the ash you get after a fire, but the analogy is useful. Think of metabolism as like a fire that converts food to energy.</p>



<p>The type of ash produced is determined by the balance of acid-forming components in a food (such as phosphate and sulphur), and alkali-forming compounds such as calcium, magnesium and potassium. And it is the acidic waste that has launched the whole crazy idea of alkaline diets because eating acid-forming foods makes your blood acidic and….disease!</p>



<p>Where to start. As with any extreme diet, there is always a kernel of truth behind it. It is true that different types of foods produce different types of metabolic by-products. Alkaline ash is produced by most fruits and vegetables, nuts and legumes. More neutral foods include most types of dietary fats. And the evil acid-forming foods are meat, poultry, fish, dairy, eggs, grains and alcohol.</p>



<p>Summary of the alkaline diet: it is plant foods for the win (except grains, because they’ll kill you🤦‍♂️) and cut out most animal foods. There’s your alkaline diet.</p>



<p>Following the pH diet is just a recipe for a vegetarian diet with a lot less highly processed foods. And if before you were eating unhealthy, but are now focussed on a new dietary paradigm of ‘alkalising your body’, then is it any wonder that you could start to feel better? It has nothing to do with acid or alkaline foods, but just a list of food rules that the diet makes you stick to. But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>pH for dummies</strong></h2>



<p>Time to circle back for a bit of pH basics. pH is, of course, a measure of acidity or alkalinity. The pH scale ranges from 1 to 14 with 1 being strongly acidic, 14 being strongly alkaline, and 7 neutral. Anything below 7 is acidic, and anything above 7 is alkaline (also known as basic).</p>



<p>Your stomach acid (and also battery acid) has a pH of about 1. Meat is about 3. Coffee is a 5. Most fruits and vegetables fall in the pH 8 to 10 range. While drain cleaner has a pH of 14. I guess Draino would count as a health tonic supplement in the alkaline diet world then?</p>



<p>Advocates of the alkaline diet claim that since the normal pH of the blood is slightly alkaline and kept in a very tightly controlled range of 7.35 to 7.45 then you should eat alkaline foods and shun acidic foods to keep it there.</p>



<p>Here’s the thing: if food could make an impact on blood pH in either an acidic or alkaline direction, then it would be life-threatening. A blood pH below 7.35 is called acidosis. Above 7.45 and it is alkalosis. Both are medical emergencies which can result in death.</p>



<p>For almost every healthy person on the planet, the body keeps blood pH in a very tight range thanks to the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507807/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">coordinated actions</a> of the lungs, kidneys and liver. But anyone who has studied physiology would know this sort of basic stuff. Those promoting an alkaline diet are not in that group.</p>



<p>Food though can change the pH of the urine and that&#8217;s one of the regulatory mechanisms the body uses to buffer against too much acidity or alkalinity. Urine though is contained in the bladder so does not affect the pH of any other part of your body.</p>



<p>So, while an alkaline diet may change the pH level in the urine, it has not been shown to cause a sustained change in blood pH levels. We even have a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001980170095" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">controlled dietary trial</a> investigating this very issue which found that acid-forming or alkaline-forming dietary changes could alter blood pH by a tiny 0.014 units, while the urine pH increased by 1.02 units.</p>



<p>Be thankful that your natural acid-base regulatory mechanisms don’t need a special diet to do their job.</p>



<p>There are though some serious diseases that have real acid-base imbalances at their core. Acidosis can happen with illnesses such as cancer, respiratory disease, severe diarrhoea, excessive alcohol use, hypoglycaemia and kidney failure to name a few. But all these conditions have underlying medical causes. They are not caused because you ate a piece of grainy bread for lunch.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Does cancer love acid?</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer is one of the diseases clearly linked to an acidic diet – at least according to those advocating an alkaline diet. It comes from the observation that cancer cells in a laboratory grow better in an acidic environment. So, follow an alkaline diet to change the pH environment of the body and….cancer cured.</p>



<p>The reality here is that it is the rapid growth of cancer cells that creates an acidic environment associated with cancer; the acidic environment does not create cancer. And yes, indeed, cancer cells can’t live in an overly alkaline environment, but neither can any of the other cells in your body. And this is theoretical anyway as it comes from laboratory studies of cancer cells grown in a petri dish so does not represent the complex nature of how tumours behave in the human body.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tying yourself in knots to make sense of it all</strong></h2>



<p>There is an alternative explanation for how an alkaline diet ‘works’ sometimes given by those pushing the diets when they read a physiology textbook and acknowledge that acidic foods don&#8217;t change blood pH.</p>



<p>It goes like this. The stress acidic foods place on the body from the need to buffer the pH results in the body pulling out alkaline-rich minerals like calcium, phosphorus and magnesium from the bones, teeth and organs to buffer against the extra acid load.</p>



<p>They say this leads to osteoporosis and fatigue, and compromises our immune system, making us vulnerable to viruses and disease. That claim doesn&#8217;t hold pH 7 neutral water.</p>



<p>Yes, that&#8217;s a great theory that if you want to apply to &#8216;acidic foods&#8217; will apply equally to &#8216;alkaline foods&#8217; so an all-alkaline diet would be just as harmful and ‘stressful’ from the need of the body to buffer the pH back into the tight range of 7.35-7.45.</p>



<p>And there is also the ‘inconvenient truth’ that when you go looking for a significant bone loss of minerals in response to acid-forming diets, you can’t see it which was the finding of <a href="https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2891-8-41" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">this meta-analysis</a> and <a href="https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2891-10-41" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">this one</a> too.</p>



<p>So even though the alkaline hypothesis tells us that higher consumption of protein, animal foods and phosphate are acidifying (and thus detrimental to bone health), what you actually find in the research studies is that diets high in these nutrients have a positive effect on calcium metabolism and markers for bone health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>More to pH than the blood</strong></h2>



<p>All this focus on blood pH pushed by alkaline diets ignores this one simple observation: pH differs throughout different body compartments.</p>



<p>You want a very acidic stomach to help with good digestion. While your mouth salvia is slightly acidic at about pH 6 which is optimal for starting the process of starch breakdown. At the same time, a lower pH in the colon from bacterial fermentation is linked to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/014107688507800311" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">favourable changes </a>in the risk of colon cancer. Then there is your skin which has a pH of about 5. Just what on earth is an alkaline diet trying to achieve by just targeting the blood?</p>



<p>All I’ve covered here is pretty basic chemistry and physiology; most of it high school level. Yet those pushing alkaline diets either ignore it in the rush to sell you their diet program and alkalised water or are completely ignorant of it. I don’t know about you, but if you’re going to bang on about pH chemistry and acid-base physiology in support of a diet it kind of would be expected that you’ve studied it – not read it off a blog.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What it all means</strong></h2>



<p>An alkaline diet &#8216;works&#8217; because it gives a person a very selective and restrictive list of foods to eat and avoid which means lots of fruits and vegetables and less highly processed food. That&#8217;s it.</p>



<p>You don’t have to believe in the crazy that is the alkaline diet, spend money on alkalinised water and needlessly cut out otherwise healthy foods like grains to make a positive change to your diet and life. I prefer to believe in the benefits of eating healthy by selecting from a wide variety of foods without the need to fill someone’s brain with pseudoscientific nonsense.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/alkaline-diet/">The alkaline diet delusion</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au">Thinking Nutrition</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Organic-Food.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Organic-Food-1024x683.png" alt="organic food" class="wp-image-6133" srcset="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Organic-Food-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Organic-Food-300x200.png 300w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Organic-Food-768x512.png 768w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Organic-Food-600x400.png 600w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Organic-Food.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>The organic food industry is big business. Fuelled by growing consumer demand by health, environmental and ethical concerns, it is no surprise it is one of the leading food trends.</p>



<p>So, let’s start by defining what is meant by &#8216;organic&#8217;. A food that is marketed as being organic would normally fall under some form of certification process. Certification covers things like chemical inputs to producing the food such as fertiliser, additives, antibiotics and pesticides. And then there could be aspects related to land use, animal breeding and housing along with record keeping and potentially on-site inspections. In Australia, there are <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/about/contact/phone/approved-certifying-bodies" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">five different</a> approved organic certification bodies.</p>



<p>In Australia, any product claiming to be ‘organic’ needs to be able to substantiate those claims regardless if they are certified or not. Otherwise, a company risks falling afoul of food regulatory and consumer bodies like the <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/advertising-and-promotions/organic-claims" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">ACCC</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is organic more nutritious?</strong></h2>



<p>Choosing organic produce for its nutritional superiority should make it a standout choice. The only problem with this view is that there is not a lot of scientific evidence to say it is true. A key reason why it is hard to answer the ‘Is organic more nutritious?’ question is that it is very hard to compare ‘apples with apples’.</p>



<p>The nutrient content of a food has a huge amount of variability. It can be affected by the growing region, rainfall, time of year of harvest and post-harvesting storage time. Each one of these factors can affect nutrient levels – to levels up to a 3-fold difference between the same food. And none of the factors I just outlined belong exclusively to the organic food domain – they apply to all grown food.</p>



<p>Getting a clearer picture if organic produce has more nutrition than conventional produce needs a lot of research work. In 2012, a <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-157-5-201209040-00007" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">systematic review</a> that included 223 studies concluded that there was a lack of strong evidence that organic foods are significantly more nutritious than conventionally grown foods.</p>



<p>But among all those 223 studies, there was plenty of variability. Yet the only nutrient that stood out as being higher was phosphorus, but….it was in conventional produce, not organic food. However, even with higher levels, the difference has no clinical health significance.</p>



<p>Moving ahead to 2014, a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/higher-antioxidant-and-lower-cadmium-concentrations-and-lower-incidence-of-pesticide-residues-in-organically-grown-crops-a-systematic-literature-review-and-metaanalyses/33F09637EAE6C4ED119E0C4BFFE2D5B1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">new review</a> study – this one including 343 studies &#8211; came out with a different conclusion. It found that organic crops had higher levels of polyphenol antioxidants by about 20 percent compared to conventional ones. But contrasting that, levels of proteins, amino acids and nitrogen were lower in organic crops.</p>



<p>Protein certainly is an important nutrient but so too are all those polyphenols so which one do you give more weight to in whether to choose organic or conventional? The choice is not that clear cut is it?</p>



<p>There have been <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/composition-differences-between-organic-and-conventional-meat-a-systematic-literature-review-and-metaanalysis/B333BC0DD4B23193DDFA2273649AE0EE" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">studies</a> that found organic meat and milk have higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids, but the word ‘organic’ here is misleading. The nutritional differences were simply because the animals foraged more on grass. It is already well known that the fatty acid profile of beef and milk will vary depending on what the animal was raised on. Raising cattle on grass doesn’t make a food ‘organic’ by that alone. It&#8217;s just grass-fed cattle that&#8217;s all.</p>



<p>But before you get too excited about those ‘amazing’ fatty acid differences in grass-fed cattle, here’s the other point: milk and meat are not the main sources of omega-3 fats in our diet. It is fish, plants, nuts and seeds that are the key dietary sources of omega-3s. So the higher levels of one nutrient in meat and dairy don’t make a big difference to your diet as a whole.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>All those pesticides</strong></h2>



<p>Okay, so no article on organic produce is complete without covering pesticides as is a key selling point of the health merits of organic.</p>



<p>When choosing organic produce, the absence of synthetic pesticides ranks high on the consumer health radar. Thankfully, pesticide levels on food in Australia are monitored and kept within very, very safe levels. And we’re talking levels below 1 percent of what is an already safe daily dose that already has its own huge margin of safety built into it. Washing and peeling food before eating can reduce residues even more.</p>



<p>However, there is research that came out of those earlier systematic reviews I covered that signalled that eating organic food means less synthetic pesticides. So, surely that’s a lay-down misère for choosing organic? I mean, everyone wants less pesticides in their body? What you’re missing here is the very misleading marketing claim of organic food that they’re ‘pesticide free’. Because they don’t always asterisk this to explain that it is only free of synthetic pesticides.</p>



<p>Let me explain. Organic certification allows produce to be grown with the use of naturally occurring pesticides such as pyrethrins, light oils, copper and sulphur and even some types of pesticide-producing bacteria. All these pesticides are just as harmful to humans in high enough doses as synthetic pesticides. There is nothing ‘safe’ about these pesticides – they’re used to kill pests after all.</p>



<p>It is what I like to call the ‘dirty little secret’ of the organic food industry. Organic food proponents are very quick to call out the potential harms of synthetic pesticides and that their food doesn’t contain any of them, but are a little more coy in letting you know that pesticides can be used in producing their food. Pesticides that aren’t normally part of the health monitoring system.</p>



<p>But let’s put pesticides in context before you get too panicked. Over 99 percent of the pesticides eaten in a typical diet are naturally present in the food to start with, not added by farmers. And of these pesticides, half will cause cancer in rats if given in high enough doses. And that cup of coffee you had this morning? It contained the same weight of known rodent carcinogens as a year’s worth of exposure to synthetic pesticides.</p>



<p>No need to be alarmed as it is these very low doses of natural pesticides in foods that may explain some of the health benefits of eating fruits and vegetables. They can stimulate the immune system by placing a very mild level of stress on the body. So, life is not about removing all pesticides from it &#8211; small amounts could be beneficial.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The fearmongering behind the ‘dirty dozen’</strong></h2>



<p>Anyone who has delved into the world of the merits of organic produce will likely have come across the ‘<a href="https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/summary.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">dirty dozen</a>’. The dirty dozen is a collated list of foods to avoid because they contain the most pesticides. Just no. There is so much wrong with this.</p>



<p>First of all, if you measure anything – be it pesticide residue, fibre or vitamin C, you will always be able to produce a ranked list. What matters is not where a food is placed on that list, but if the values are of any health significance. And when it comes to pesticide residues, even foods at the top of the list are still well, well under any level that presents any safety concerns.</p>



<p>The data used to compile the dirty dozen list is legitimate as comes from US Government sources. But the ranking system takes no account of the different levels of toxicity between pesticides – they purely go on the amount present. And because it’s a list, no matter what the conventional food industry did to reduce pesticide levels, this list will always have a ‘dirty dozen’ on the top of it.</p>



<p>An even bigger issue with the dirty dozen list is that it is only about synthetic pesticides. A free pass is given for all the ‘organic’ pesticides that I mentioned before that can and are used in producing organic produce.</p>



<p>And here’s one interesting thing you may not know about the ‘dirty dozen’ list: it’s put together by an organisation called the <a href="https://www.ewg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Environmental Working Group</a>. Sounds legit doesn’t it? Except this group, while being a not-for-profit organisation, gets a nice slice of its funding from the organic food industry. This is also an organisation that has a clear anti-GMO stance and has dipped its toe in the water of some anti-vax rhetoric too. To say they are not held in high regard by the general scientific community would be polite.</p>



<p>But here is the biggest kicker for any concerns you may have about pesticides in food. If pesticide residues in conventional produce were so bad for us, we should see clear evidence of an increased risk of cancer and other chronic diseases with increasing fruit and vegetable consumption. The opposite is true.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taste expectations</strong></h2>



<p>Okay, so if there isn’t a strong case to choose organic based on nutrients and pesticide residues, then surely organic is better because it simply tastes better? Um, no. Now, I’m not denying for one second your taste experience of organic food – it is 100 percent correct and valid. But you see, taste is a very personal one and is largely based on expectation.</p>



<p>Comparing the taste of organic versus conventional needs to be based on produce of similar quality. A freshly picked conventional apple will taste better than an organic apple that has sat sadly unloved for weeks on the produce shelf. And the same applies in reverse too. So you have to take this into account to have a fair taste test of organic versus conventional.</p>



<p>But what does <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031816-044437" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">science say</a> when you do the only valid experiment here and that’s blind people to whether the food they’re tasting is organic or conventional? Are you ready to be shocked? People can’t taste the difference.</p>



<p>Now I could cite some nerdy scientific studies to support this, but for a change of pace, I’m going to cite a YouTube clip. Not just any clip mind you, but one involving a bunch of pranksters who infiltrated a high-end foodie trade show. They passed around plates of McDonald’s food they deconstructed and reassembled into gourmet hors d&#8217;oeuvres. All complete with a tale of the foods’ providence (and being organic too obvs). And the foodies lapped it up and raved about the taste sensation.</p>



<p>If they were told it was McDonald’s they would have had utter disdain for it. But change the description and appearance of the food and you have yourself a gourmand’s delight. Taste: it’s largely based on expectations. If you want to catch the 3-minute clip, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Qa6QXBxxWw" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">here it is</a> and heads up: it’s in Dutch so put your subtitles on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What it all means</strong></h2>



<p>This article was not written to change your mind to turn you from organic back to conventional produce. You do you and if you like organic, keep eating it. Because the whole organic versus conventional food debate is a pointless distraction. On the health scales, there is little to separate organic and conventional produce &#8211; apart from price.</p>



<p>Rather than focusing on getting a few extra antioxidants from organic fruit, we should be trying to eat a lot more fruit and vegetables to begin with. The biggest food health issue we are facing is how little fruit and vegetables we are eating in the first place. Addressing this by eating more foods that we know are good for us will make any ‘organic vs conventional’ debate fade into insignificance.</p>



<p>If you feel the price premium of organic is worth it, then by all means, make buying organic a priority. For someone on a tight budget, then fear not that you are doing your health any harm by buying conventional produce.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/is-organic-food-a-better-choice/">Is organic food a better choice?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au">Thinking Nutrition</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

And finally, I’ll outline the practical things that are in your control to help prevent and treat a hangover.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hangover-Cures.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hangover-Cures-1024x683.png" alt="hangover cures" class="wp-image-6092" srcset="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hangover-Cures-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hangover-Cures-300x200.png 300w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hangover-Cures-768x512.png 768w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hangover-Cures-600x400.png 600w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hangover-Cures.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>The dreaded hangover. That painful period between trying to get out of bed without hating life and once again being a normal, contributing member of society. If you have ever experienced a nasty hangover, then you know just how much the combination of tiredness, headache, nausea and poor concentration can crush you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The science behind a hangover</strong></h2>



<p>Hangovers happen because of the effects of alcohol (which is a toxin after all) on the brain and the rest of the body. So, let’s look at what is going on to explain the classic collection of hangover symptoms.</p>



<p>To start with, alcohol is a diuretic. That explains the dehydration and much of the regret you feel the next day from drinking too much. On top of that, frequent trips to the bathroom during the night mean sleep disturbances. That makes you even more tired the next day.</p>



<p>But the symptoms of a hangover can&#8217;t all be blamed on dehydration and poor sleep. Alcohol irritates the stomach. This leads to inflammation which also causes the digestive system to produce more gastric acid. This contributes to the nausea and queasy stomach of a hangover.</p>



<p>Hangovers could also be driven by the way alcohol messes with your immune system. There is a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7408936/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">strong correlation</a> between high levels of cytokines – which are molecules that the immune system uses for signalling and to control inflammation &#8211; and hangover symptoms. Normally, the body might use cytokines to trigger a fever or inflammatory response to battle an infection. Excessive drinking can cause cytokine release, which leads to muscle aches, fatigue, headache and nausea. It can also affect memory and cause irritation.</p>



<p>It gets worse. When the body metabolises alcohol, it creates a toxic by-product called acetaldehyde. That acetaldehyde is up to 30 times more toxic than alcohol itself. The build-up of acetaldehyde leads to sweating, skin flushing, nausea, vomiting, and headaches. And it seems that people who have a genetic variant in one of the enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism (called aldehyde dehydrogenase-2) have <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1097/01.ALC.0000172457.62535.EE" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">higher levels of acetaldehyde</a>. These people may get hit with a hangover even worse.</p>



<p>Finally, a hangover exists hand-in-hand with many hormonal and metabolic changes that are plausible causes of the classic fatigue and brain fog of a hangover. Here, you can see changes in insulin, cortisol, testosterone, aldosterone and growth hormone. Even brain chemicals like adrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and the endocannabinoid system are affected. These chemicals regulate immune response, cell communication, appetite, metabolism and memory.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It&#8217;s true, dark spirits are worse for your hangover</strong></h2>



<p>You may have heard that dark-coloured spirits such as whiskey and rum as well as red wine can make your hangover worse. And you heard correctly. These types of drinks are high in distillation and fermentation products called congeners. Congeners give distilled alcoholic drinks their distinctive taste and smell and affect the flavour of non-distilled drinks. They are also considered a likely culprit contributing to hangovers.  So, there could be something to be said for opting for white wine over red wine or vodka instead of bourbon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hangover cures put to the test</strong></h2>



<p>Okay, enough of the hangover science – it is undoubtedly causing way too many traumatic flashbacks for many of you. Can you cure it? Let’s look at some of the popular options.</p>



<p>The greasy breakfast is a popular hangover cure to help put a ‘lining back on your stomach’. The benefit the next day is more of a placebo effect which, if it makes you feel better, then that’s not such a bad thing. With food though, you get the greatest benefit by having it the night before as food helps to slow down the absorption of alcohol from the stomach.</p>



<p>One thing that will help with a hangover is to rehydrate. This is where those popular sports drinks can help. They speed up water absorption and replace electrolytes lost through increased urination. Having it before bed may be a good preventative measure too.</p>



<p>What about a strong cup of coffee? Caffeine will help make you more alert but will do little to sober you up. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03219.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Studies</a> that looked at the effects of caffeinated versus non-caffeinated alcoholic drinks on a simulated driving task and alertness found that caffeine did not reduce the effects of alcohol on driving ability or reaction time.</p>



<p>Then there is the popular ‘hair of the dog’ where you attempt to drink yourself out of a hangover. All this does is delay the hangover as your body switches to metabolising the new alcohol you’ve ingested. Once it has done that job, then you’re back to square one. And even worse, you’ve got more by-products of alcohol metabolism in your system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hangover supplements</strong></h2>



<p>Can you cure a hangover with a magic pill? Sadly, no foods or supplements are proven to prevent hangovers (at least supplements that have been tested at least more than once), yet the Internet is full of supposed cures. Ginseng, Japanese raisin tree, prickly pear cactus, Korean pear, and a mixture of pear, green grape, and the Japanese herb Ashibata have all been tested and have at least one study to support them. However, few studies have been replicated. And even studies that show a benefit only look at certain aspects of a hangover and are normally tested in a controlled situation which may not replicate very well a classic ‘big night out’ on the beers.</p>



<p>The British Medical Journal has also weighed into the elusive search for a hangover cure with a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/331/7531/1515" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">systematic review</a> of randomised-controlled trials. But their comprehensive search for any medical therapy that could prevent or treat hangovers came up with naught. Their conclusion? The most effective way to avoid the symptoms of a hangover is to practise abstinence or moderation. It may not be what you want to hear, but it is the most effective cure we have yet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are there health benefits?</strong></h2>



<p>One final question to ponder today is if there could be any health benefits to be gained from the pain that alcohol can cause you. The health harms of alcohol are long indeed so I won’t go into a lot of detail about those, but every now and then you see something surface about the health benefits of alcohol. Is there any truth to this?</p>



<p>A low level of alcohol consumption may offer a small benefit in reducing overall earlier mortality rates – mostly by offering some degree of protection against coronary heart disease in those with existing risk factors. Alcohol can raise the levels of HDL-cholesterol. This is the type of cholesterol that removes cholesterol from the blood and reduce the ‘stickiness’ of blood and the risk of blood clots forming.</p>



<p>Scientists call the observed small health benefit of alcohol &#8216;the <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-02911-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">J curve</a> effect&#8217; where a benefit is seen with light to moderate amounts of consumption (1-2 drinks per day), but skyrocketing health risks with increasing consumption. There is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0741832918301873" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">debate</a> though if the J curve effect may be from other factors such as healthier lifestyles of light drinkers, rather than the alcohol itself.</p>



<p>What this means is that the relationship between alcohol consumption and mortality is complex and can vary depending on various factors such as the amount and frequency of alcohol consumed, individual health conditions, and other lifestyle factors.</p>



<p>However, the truth is that alcohol&#8217;s health benefits mostly apply to men over 40 and women over 50. These benefits are seen in those who consume one to two standard drinks per day or less. Younger people do not get the same health benefits from drinking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What it all means</strong></h2>



<p>If you can’t cure a hangover, you can do some things to help reduce it the night before. And for that, make sure that you:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Eat food when drinking</li>



<li>Alternate your drinks with water</li>



<li>Try a sports drink before bed and the morning after</li>



<li>Get plenty of sleep</li>



<li>Get active the next day – the endorphin release will make you feel better</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you have a hangover, there’s no magic pill to cure it. But something as simple as aspirin and a strong coffee can help to clear your head and perk you up a little as you bunker down and wait it out.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/hangover-cures/">Hangover cures: does anything work?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au">Thinking Nutrition</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Tendons are collagen-infused super-strong bridges that connect muscles to bones helping you to move your limbs. When overused, overloaded or damaged, these same tendons can cause us a lot of pain and movement impairment. Aside from medical treatments and physiotherapy rehabilitation programs that help tendon injuries heal, there has been growing interest in how specialised tendon-targeted nutritional supplements can aid repair and recovery. And for good reason, hydrolysed collagen is a key component of many of these supplements. In this blog post, I look at where the evidence stands for nutritional supplements helping with tendon healing.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Tendons.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Tendons-1024x683.png" alt="collagen tendon repair" class="wp-image-6072" srcset="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Tendons-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Tendons-300x200.png 300w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Tendons-768x512.png 768w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Tendons-600x400.png 600w, https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Tendons.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>This blog post is all about tendons. So what are they? Tendons are strong rope-like bands of connective tissue that attach muscle to bone. That makes tendons essential in helping limbs move as they provide the bridge linking the force generated by the muscle to the bone. Tendons also help reduce the risk of muscle injury by absorbing some of the impact force your muscles experience when you run or jump.</p>



<p>Tendons are made up mostly of collagen. You’ll also find elastin in tendons which, as its name suggests, is a protein that gives tissues some degree of stretch and recoil ability.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tendon troubles</strong></h2>



<p>Tendons do a lot of work. And in cases of overuse and injury, this can cause pain, swelling and reduced performance. There are two common conditions affecting the health of tendons. The first is inflammation which is called tendonitis. The other condition, called tendinosis, is more associated with the breakdown of the collagen fibres that make up most of the tendon. Collectively, these conditions come under an umbrella term called <a href="https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/582" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">tendinopathy</a>.</p>



<p>Overuse is a common cause of tendinopathy. This is where the tendon is repeatedly strained until tiny tears form. The shoulder, wrist, knee, shin and heel are the common places you’ll see tendinopathies.</p>



<p>Sports people are at high risk of developing tendinopathy. As one example, in runners, some estimates put the incidence of tendinopathy at 10 percent developing it each year. In athletes, common locations for tendinopathy include the Achilles and patellar knee cap. Tendinopathy is also common in people over the age of 40, in those who do repetitive tasks, and in people with poor muscle strength.</p>



<p>Now this website has its focus on nutrition as that’s my expert area. So I’m going to leave well alone the medical and physiotherapy management of tendinopathies – you can do your own reading on this area and seek out appropriate professional advice. And because the symptoms of tendinopathy can be similar to other conditions such as arthritis, it is important to seek medical advice when faced with joint pain that doesn’t resolve after a week or two of rest.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Treating tendon injuries with nutrition</strong></h2>



<p>With tendinopathy such a common problem, there has been a lot of interest in the potential benefit that dietary interventions and nutritional supplements could play in treating it. Especially when used together with medical and physiotherapy treatment.</p>



<p>Right on cue, we have a recently published <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37146985/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">review paper</a> that collated the research field of nutritional supplements for treating tendinopathies. It explored what interventions have been tried and what were the outcomes.</p>



<p>Let’s get into what the review looked at. In all, 16 studies (12 of which were randomised controlled trials) were identified. The studies looked at a range of nutritional supplements in the clinical management of tendinopathy. The tendinopathies were located in the Achilles, rotator cuff, patellar and plantar heel.</p>



<p>I’ll go over in a bit of detail the nutritional supplements used so you can appreciate the common themes.</p>



<p>There were two studies that used a commercial supplement called Tendoactive<sup>®</sup>. In it, you’ll find mucopolysaccharides, type I collagen and vitamin C. Mucopolysaccharides are long chains of sugar molecules found throughout the body that provide structural support and lubrication and also regulate cell growth.</p>



<p>Three studies used the commercial supplement Tendisulfur<sup>®</sup>. This supplement contains methylsulfonylmethane (a donor of sulphur used in collagen production), hydrolysed collagen, arginine, lysine, vitamin C, bromelain (which is an enzyme found in pineapples and linked with reducing inflammation) along with chondroitin, glucosamine, the herb Boswellia (frankincense) and myrrh of the biblical “Three wise men” fame.</p>



<p>Two studies used the commercial supplement Tenosan<sup>®</sup> which contains arginine, alpha-ketoglutarate, hydrolysed type I collagen, methylsulfonylmethane, vitamin C, bromelain and ViNitrox<sup>®</sup> which contains a mixture of plant polyphenols.</p>



<p>Collagen peptides alone were featured in two studies. The remaining studies used omega-3 fatty acids, turmeric, hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB), and vitamin C either in isolation or combined with gelatin (which is simply deatured collagen). And finally, one study used creatine.</p>



<p>That’s a real mixed bag, but the clear common ingredient was collagen. More about collagen shortly.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What did the review find?</strong></h4>



<p>Most of the studies found positive clinical outcomes. Improvements in pain, function and tendon structure could all be seen following nutritional supplementation.</p>



<p>When nutritional supplements were combined with other treatments, it appeared the benefit was magnified. Common treatments included eccentric training (which corresponds to the downward lowering phase of weight lifting) or extracorporeal shockwave therapy (known as ESWT) where high-frequency shock waves are given to an injured tendon to stimulate healing.</p>



<p>Many of the supplements I’ve just outlined have anti-inflammatory properties. That means they could be capable of downregulating inflammatory pathways in tendinopathy. So, this could explain some of the pain benefits. Reduced pain is definitely a great outcome for a person, but there could be other effects going on related to collagen synthesis and tendon repair. This is the biggest area of interest, but one that the review was less clear on giving direction on.</p>



<p>The review was not without limitations. It included a range of study designs so there was a lot of variability between the studies. So, treat the findings with some level of caution.</p>



<p>While nutritional supplements may seem safe and have fewer side effects compared to pain medications, they still carry risks. This is especially true for high-performing athletes who undergo drug testing for banned substances and where there can be a risk of supplement contamination. For anyone considering trialling supplements for tendon repair and recovery, it is important to be educated about their use and what exactly you are taking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Collagen for your joints</strong></h2>



<p>But back to collagen as that was the common ingredient across the supplements studied in the review. Collagen makes up about three-quarters of the dry weight of tendons. That&#8217;s a lot of collagen. The crosslinking strength of collagen helps the tendon to withstand high-impact stresses and shear forces.</p>



<p>The research base for using oral hydrolysed collagen for a range of health benefits has been growing. Taking a more exercise recovery and joint injury perspective, a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8521576/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">review paper</a> from 2021 looked at the role of collagen supplementation. And the findings, albeit based on a small research field, were positive for collagen. It suggested that collagen at doses of 5 to 15 grams per day is beneficial in improving joint functionality and reducing joint pain. This benefit was enhanced when complemented with a rehabilitation exercise protocol.</p>



<p>A reason why collagen supplements may reduce joint pain is that they increase collagen levels in the cartilage. Together with also increasing the production of proteoglycan (an important structural protein in connective tissue) and elastin – thereby reducing tissue damage and decreasing pain. It is also thought that collagen peptides may display some level of anti-inflammatory effect, further decreasing pain and inflammation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Collagen and skin health</strong></h2>



<p>It is easy to dismiss most of what I’ve covered in this post as it is true: the evidence base is still small. Among the common criticisms you hear about collagen, many dismiss it out of hand for having no evidence for a benefit and with no plausible reason why it should have any effect different to any other protein source you eat. Oh, and all that research is funded by ‘Big Collagen’ don’t you know? All three claims are completely….wrong.</p>



<p>The most researched area to do with oral collagen supplements is to do with skin health. We now have dozens of double-blinded randomised controlled trials showing a benefit on skin hydration, skin elasticity and wrinkles. I went into a deep dive into this area in a previous blog post so you can get the full details <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/collagen-supplements-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">here</a>.</p>



<p>In that blog post, I outlined the positive findings of a systematic review from 2021 of 19 clinical trials that looked at collagen supplements and skin health. But research never stands still and there has been yet more research since then. So much so, that only in the last few months, a new <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/9/2080" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">systematic review</a> has been published.</p>



<p>This new review could analyse 26 randomised controlled trials of oral collagen supplements that looked at skin hydration and skin elasticity. And just like the 2021 review, a significant benefit was seen with almost every study pointing in the right direction for a benefit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No, all the research is not funded by the collagen industry</strong></h2>



<p>But isn&#8217;t all the research funded by the collagen industry? No. Of those 26 studies on skin health I just mentioned, 11 had no funding from the collagen industry nor did any of the research team report a conflict of interest. And these ‘untainted’ trials were just as likely to show a benefit as those with industry links. Playing the &#8216;industry funding&#8217; card is a lazy form of critical analysis.</p>



<p>Sure, you can always find fault with any individual study. But for anyone to claim that there is ‘no evidence collagen supplements work’ is living in scientific denial. If anything, I am more sceptical of people who dismiss collagen out of hand. That was a valid position 10 years ago with a limited research base. But not today. And especially when faced with growing evidence across many different areas where it seems collagen supplements offer a benefit for many conditions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How collagen works</strong></h2>



<p>Those dismissive claims that collagen is no different to any other protein you eat so can&#8217;t have a unique biological effect are just so far off the mark. There is a plausible and well-understood mechanism where collagen can have direct effects on collagen production in the body different to any other protein source.</p>



<p>That’s because when you eat collagen, it is digested and absorbed into the bloodstream where both single amino acids and unique dipeptides and tripeptides appear. These small peptides have a unique fingerprint because of the presence of the amino acid hydroxyproline. What’s special about hydroxyproline? It is unique to collagen and is made from the amino acid proline with the help of vitamin C. So these small peptide fragments only exist in the blood from internal collagen breakdown or from the collagen we eat.</p>



<p>Absorbed collagen peptides not only redistribute to the skin but can act as signalling molecules, binding to receptors on the surface of fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are skin cells that are major producers of collagen. This receptor binding stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen, elastin (needed for skin elasticity) and hyaluronic acid (for water retention). This is a key point as it provides a plausible mechanism by which collagen consumption can directly affect our skin. And similar types of pathways exist in cells that produce collagen found in cartilage and tendons.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What it all means</strong></h2>



<p>There is a plausible use case for why collagen-containing nutritional supplements could support tendon injury repair and recovery. The rationale for why collagen may work with tendon repair has a solid support base coming from the benefit of hydrolysed collagen supplements on skin health along with joint conditions such as osteoarthritis. All from something that is naturally part of foods and has little evidence of any adverse problems.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/collagen-tendon-repair/">Collagen supplements: a promising aid in tendon repair</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au">Thinking Nutrition</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
