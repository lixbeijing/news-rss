         <title>Magnetic field improves the quality of frozen tilapia fillets by decreasing the ice crystals during freezing process</title>

A study on the effect of different frequencies of alternating magnetic fields‐assisted freezing on ice crystal formation and quality changes of tilapia.

Summary
In this study, the alternating magnetic field (AMF) with frequency of 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 Hz at magnetic field intensity of 5 mT was used to assist the freezing of tilapia fillets, with no magnetic field (NMF) as a control group. The evaluation of thawed tilapia fillets encompassed an assessment of freezing curve, texture, microstructure, moisture state and protein structure, followed by a subsequent analysis of their correlation. The findings showed that the application of a magnetic field during the freezing process yielded favourable outcomes in enhancing the overall quality of tilapia fillets. Among them, 200 Hz had the best effect. Under the condition, the frozen tilapia fillets assisted by magnetic field showed the shortest freezing time, the least decrease in hardness and elasticity and the best chewiness after thawing. The size of the ice crystals generated during freezing was small and uniform, and the fractal dimension of the frozen sections was the highest. Muscle tissue was the least damaged, which led to the improvement of its water‐holding capacity. Magnetic field‐assisted freezing was found to maintain the α‐helix and β‐sheet in the secondary structure of proteins. The correlation analysis showed that cohesion, elasticity, fractal dimension, FD, A2, A22 and β‐turn were closely related to the quality changes of tilapia fillets after magnetic field treatment.

         <title>Effect of phosphorylated modification on natural inulin: structural characterisation and gel properties</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9020-9028, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Firstly, we studied the phosphorylation of modified natural inulin. Subsequently, we examined the structural characterisation and gel properties of phosphorylated modified PDFI.

Summary
To improve the gel properties of natural inulin (FI), in this study, FI was phosphorylated to prepare natural inulin phosphodiester (PDFI). The structures of FI and PDFI were characterised by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), particle size and scanning electron microscopy. FI and PDFI gels (mass fraction 20%–40%) were prepared and stored for 0–7 days to study their effects on water‐holding capacity, rheology and texture properties. The FTIR spectra showed absorption peaks of P‐O‐C and P=O bonds, indicating that some hydroxyl groups were replaced and phosphorylation was successful. Compared with FI, the specific surface area of PDFI was increased 7.7‐fold and the microstructure was smoother. When the fraction of PDFI was 35%, the water‐holding rate of PDFI gel was 21.2%, 23.3%, 19.7%, 19.1% and 19.3% higher than FI gel at different storage time, respectively. PDFI gel with higher mass fraction (25%–40%) had lower hardness. Rheological analysis showed that PDFI gels had stronger viscoelastic and solid‐like properties. These results reveal native inulin phosphorylation improved gel properties.

The ALINFA intervention showed the effectiveness on changing the dietary pattern of primary school children. This improvement reflects on the positive influence children's microbiota.

Summary
Gut microbiota seems to play a critical role in health and disease. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a nutritional intervention in children 6–12 years old on the microbiota and to identify possible dietary components involved in the change. A 2‐month parallel, controlled randomised trial was conducted. The nutritional intervention was based on the recommendations of the Mediterranean diet, for both intervention groups, with the difference that in the ALINFA group a more intensive intervention based on a complete diet, while in the control group, dietary advice was provided. After the intervention, ALINFA group showed an increase in the richness and diversity of their microbiota as well as changes in the abundance of different bacterial heels. These changes were mainly influences by fibre intake and the type of fat consumed. The ALINFA nutritional intervention seems to be able to positively influence children's microbiota, showing significant changes within 2 months.

         <title>Application of antioxidant peptide‐based coating on fresh‐cut apple</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9051-9059, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Physicochemical indicators of shelf‐life were measured on fresh‐cut apples treated with different coatings, and those highly correlated with shelf‐life were selected for predicting the shelf‐life using the PLSR model.

Summary
Fresh‐cut apples are susceptible to enzymatic browning and spoilage. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different coatings on fresh‐cut apples and develop a predictive model for their shelf life. The apples were treated with antioxidant peptide from Candida utilis (CUH), carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS), and composite coatings, and their physicochemical properties were subsequently evaluated. Key factors identified through correlation analysis of shelf life were used as input parameters for a partial least squares regression (PLSR) model to predict the shelf life of fresh‐cut apples treated with different coatings. The results indicate that CUH, CMCS, and CUH‐CMCS coatings effectively delay the deterioration of fresh‐cut apples. Notably, the CUH‐CMCS composite coating demonstrated superior performance, showing only a slight 3.50% increase in the browning index (BI) during storage. Minimal changes were observed in weight loss and firmness, while overall total acidity (TA) and pH exhibited slight decreases. Moreover, the levels of ascorbic acid (Vc), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and peroxidase (POD) were significantly lower compared to the control group, and the total bacterial count increased by no more than 0.7 log CFU g−1. The PLSR model accurately predicted the shelf life of fresh‐cut apples treated with different coatings, with Rc2 and Rp2 values both exceeding 0.90. The research results indicate that the coating and model developed in this study offer a novel approach for preserving and managing fresh‐cut apples.

         <title>Extraction of bioactive compounds from peel and seeds of pitomba (Talisia esculenta) using eutectic solvents</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9060-9071, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that pitomba peel and seeds yield natural extracts with high antioxidant capacity. Significant flavonoid and phenolic compound levels were achieved using deep eutectic solvents (DES), particularly choline chloride with glycerol, showing potential for applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

Summary
This study explores using pitomba peel and seeds to obtain a natural extract with high antioxidant capacity, employing extraction techniques with eutectic solvents combined with agitation and temperature control. The analysis revealed that, for the extraction with pitomba peel residues, the average levels of phenolic compounds did not show significant differences except for the extraction with ethanol. In contrast, the extractions performed with pitomba seeds showed significant differences, with the combination of choline chloride with lactic acid and choline chloride with glycerol providing the highest phenolic compound values. For flavonoids, the highest amount was obtained with the extraction using L‐proline and levulinic acid for the pitomba peel and ethanol and choline chloride with levulinic acid for the pitomba seeds. The results of the DPPH and FRAP assays indicate that, for antioxidant activity, the highest DPPH value was achieved with the extraction of pitomba peel using choline chloride with glycerol. In contrast, for pitomba seeds, elevated values were found with choline chloride with glycerol and choline chloride with levulinic acid. In the FRAP assay, the averages between L‐proline with levulinic acid and choline chloride with glycerol were not significantly different, showing high values. For pitomba seeds, the averages between ethanol and choline chloride with glycerol were also not significantly different and showed the highest obtained values. The results demonstrate that the extracts obtained from pitomba residues are rich in valuable compounds for potential applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. They highlight the significant levels of flavonoids extracted from pitomba peel and seeds and emphasise the effectiveness of deep eutectic solvents (DES), particularly choline chloride with glycerol, in the extraction process.

     alt="Extraction of bioactive compounds from peel and seeds of pitomba (Talisia esculenta) using eutectic solvents"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates that pitomba peel and seeds yield natural extracts with high antioxidant capacity. Significant flavonoid and phenolic compound levels were achieved using deep eutectic solvents (DES), particularly choline chloride with glycerol, showing potential for applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study explores using pitomba peel and seeds to obtain a natural extract with high antioxidant capacity, employing extraction techniques with eutectic solvents combined with agitation and temperature control. The analysis revealed that, for the extraction with pitomba peel residues, the average levels of phenolic compounds did not show significant differences except for the extraction with ethanol. In contrast, the extractions performed with pitomba seeds showed significant differences, with the combination of choline chloride with lactic acid and choline chloride with glycerol providing the highest phenolic compound values. For flavonoids, the highest amount was obtained with the extraction using L-proline and levulinic acid for the pitomba peel and ethanol and choline chloride with levulinic acid for the pitomba seeds. The results of the DPPH and FRAP assays indicate that, for antioxidant activity, the highest DPPH value was achieved with the extraction of pitomba peel using choline chloride with glycerol. In contrast, for pitomba seeds, elevated values were found with choline chloride with glycerol and choline chloride with levulinic acid. In the FRAP assay, the averages between L-proline with levulinic acid and choline chloride with glycerol were not significantly different, showing high values. For pitomba seeds, the averages between ethanol and choline chloride with glycerol were also not significantly different and showed the highest obtained values. The results demonstrate that the extracts obtained from pitomba residues are rich in valuable compounds for potential applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. They highlight the significant levels of flavonoids extracted from pitomba peel and seeds and emphasise the effectiveness of deep eutectic solvents (DES), particularly choline chloride with glycerol, in the extraction process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effect of long‐chain inulin on the rheological properties, water state, gluten structure, and microstructure of frozen dough</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9117-9130, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Firstly, we explored the effects of different levels of substitution of long‐chain inulin (FXL) on the water state and rheological properties of frozen dough. Subsequently, we investigated the influence of FXL on the secondary structure and depolymerisation characteristics of gluten protein within the frozen dough.

Summary
This study aimed to investigate the effects of long‐chain inulin (FXL) on the water state, rheological properties, gluten depolymerisation, and microstructure of frozen dough. The results suggested that FXL improved the water state and rheological properties of the frozen dough. It also significantly enhanced the proportion of bound water, G′, G″ value, and the pasting properties of the frozen dough. FXL effectively increased the content of disulfide bonds, α‐helix, and β‐sheet structures in gluten, thereby enhancing its thermal stability and inhibiting depolymerisation. Microstructure results demonstrated that FXL improved the continuity and uniformity of the gluten‐starch network structure in frozen dough, effectively reducing the mechanical damage caused by ice crystals. The addition of 1 g/100 g FXL better alleviate the deterioration of frozen dough quality during frozen storage and improved its overall quality. These results indicated that FXL can be used as a promising cryoprotectant in frozen dough.

3D visual reconstruction of a single wheat grain based on X‐ray μCT and the assessment of morphological and structural parameters of different tissues

Summary
The intricate task of achieving three‐dimensional (3D) visual reconstruction of wheat kernels represents a notable challenge within the domain of digital grain analysis, playing a pivotal role in the realms of grain storage, processing, and breeding. However, existing investigations focused on individual kernels predominantly encompass dimensions such as length, width, height, and epidermal texture features, with a tendency to be invasive to the internal organisational structure of the kernel. Non‐local mean filtering algorithm is proposed to segment various tissues, and the 2D grey scale images are extracted from X‐ray micro‐computed tomography (μCT) to reconstruct a meticulous 3D visualisation model of individual wheat grains. Furthermore, building upon this foundation, an exhaustive assessment of morphological and structural parameters pertaining to each facet of the internal organisation of the wheat seed grain is conducted. Notably, these calculated parameters align with data generated by prior researchers，with 80% of the volume of the endosperm, 12% of the pericarp, about 2% of the endosperm and scutellum, and 4% of the pores. The established parameters and resultant 3D visual models serve as foundational components for subsequent in‐depth examinations into various physicochemical properties, including quality characteristics, heat, and mass transfer attributes, as well as variations in its morphological structure during breeding, which are pertinent to individual grains. This research contributes valuable insights and methodologies that can propel the advancement of studies in wheat kernel analysis.

         <title>Evaluating the multifaceted impact of Cephalaria extract on dough quality: Antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic properties</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9147-9156, December 2024. </description>

The addition of Cephalaria extracts at the optimal concentration significantly enhanced the dough properties. The findings indicate that Cephalaria extract imparts multiple beneficial attributes to the dough.

Summary
Cephalaria syriaca, known as cephalaria, is an annual, pilose plant with pink‐purple flowers growing wild in wheat fields. Viscoelastic properties of gluten‐free doughs can be improved by adding cephalaria. However, this addition results in some undesirable properties in bread such as bitter taste and dark internal colour. This study aimed to reduce these effects by obtaining cephalaria obtained from distilled water and ethanol extracts and to increase the potential use of extracts in bread production. Different proportions of water and ethanol extracts obtained from oil‐free cephalaria were added to bread by creating a model with Mixture Design, and the optimum concentration was determined by farinograph trials. The antioxidative, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic effects of extract and the effect of cephalaria on yeast activity were examined. Cephalaria extracts had no measurable antimicrobial effect and no antifungal effect on Rhizopus stolonifer, while an antifungal effect was found against A. niger and P. expansum. The IC50 value was found to be 4.15 mg mL−1 for ethanol extract while the water extract had no effect on cells. The addition of extract had no negative effect on the number of yeasts in sourdough fermentation. The study has improved the usage of cephalaria by using water and ethanol extracts in dough.

Decontamination of ochratoxin A from raisins.

Summary
In this research, the effects of washing treatments (potassium carbonate (PC), potassium hydroxide (PH), peracetic acid (PA), alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP)), ultrasound (US) and high‐intensity pulsed light (HIPL) technologies on the removal of ochratoxin A (OTA) residues in raisins were investigated. PC at 5 min (66.60%), PH at 10 min (65.25%), alkaline hydrogen peroxide at 5 min (63.30%) and HIPL at 12 J cm−2 (62.50%) were found to be the most successful applications in OTA degradation, respectively. Although the OTA degradation rate was high after chemical washing for 10 min, the raisins had a chemical odour. The results show that HIPL effectively reduces OTA levels in raisins without causing any quality loss.

         <title>The impact of calcium sequestration on the material and structural properties of acid milk gels and corresponding cream cheeses</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9189-9202, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insoluble calcium content in the manufacturing process of cream cheese is a significant variable in determining the rheological, mechanical and microstructural properties of forming acid milk gels and their corresponding cream cheeses.

Summary
We report on the role of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in addition to the structural and material properties of acid milk gels formed via addition of glucono‐delta‐lactone (GDL) and these properties of corresponding analogue cream cheeses prepared from these gels. Increasing addition of EDTA to cheese milks prior to acidulation reduced the concentration of insoluble calcium in the milks. Acid gelation of milks, as measured by small deformation rheology, showed a decreased rate of gelation and lower relative elastic modulus of gels with increasing EDTA concentration. The sequestration of colloidal calcium phosphate from the casein micelle by the addition of EDTA led to the lower gelation rate and elastic modulus. The lower extent of ionic binding is considered the causative mechanism for formation of weaker gel structures.

&lt;p&gt;Insoluble calcium content in the manufacturing process of cream cheese is a significant variable in determining the rheological, mechanical and microstructural properties of forming acid milk gels and their corresponding cream cheeses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report on the role of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in addition to the structural and material properties of acid milk gels formed via addition of glucono-delta-lactone (GDL) and these properties of corresponding analogue cream cheeses prepared from these gels. Increasing addition of EDTA to cheese milks prior to acidulation reduced the concentration of insoluble calcium in the milks. Acid gelation of milks, as measured by small deformation rheology, showed a decreased rate of gelation and lower relative elastic modulus of gels with increasing EDTA concentration. The sequestration of colloidal calcium phosphate from the casein micelle by the addition of EDTA led to the lower gelation rate and elastic modulus. The lower extent of ionic binding is considered the causative mechanism for formation of weaker gel structures. Cream cheeses prepared using acid gels with GDL acidulant were compositionally unaffected by EDTA concentration. However, variations in &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;′ observed in the acid gels containing increasing levels of EDTA correlated with large deformation material property changes in cream cheese analogues. In addition, the increasing inclusion of EDTA in cheese milks translated to reduced water-holding capacity of the cream cheeses prepared from those milks. These results provide insights on the specific role of milk calcium on the structure, material and physical properties of acid milk gels and corresponding cream cheese analogues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Color of doenjang is important for consumers' perception of gu‐soo.

Summary
Doenjang, one of the representative soybean‐fermented foods in Korea, is a widely consumed food ingredient of stew, soup, and sauce/dip. In Korea, the term ‘gu‐soo’ is widely used to describe sensory characteristics of doenjang. Previous studies have reported that appearance characteristics such as colour, moisture content, and bean‐to‐paste ratio may affect consumer perception of gu‐soo in doenjang. The purpose of this study was to determine effects of appearance characteristics such as colour and bean‐to‐paste ratio on consumers' perception of gu‐soo in doenjang. A total of nine doenjang samples with three different colours and three different bean‐and‐paste ratios (0%, 25%, and 50%) were prepared. Consumer (N = 101) tests were conducted to measure consumer perception and acceptance of nine samples. Check‐all‐that‐apply (CATA) test on sensory characteristics perceived by each doenjang was also conducted. As a result of the CATA test, doenjang samples made of the same type of doenjang were perceived to have similar sensory characteristics. Having high levels of beans in the paste did not affect the liking attribute or consumer perception of ‘gu‐soo’ in doenjang (P &gt; 0.05). Overall, consumers' perception of gu‐soo were influenced by the colour of doenjang (P &lt; 0.05). This study found out that the colour of doenjang was more important in consumer perception of ‘gu‐soo’ in doenjang than bean content in the paste.

         <title>Effect of ultrasound pretreatment combined with different drying methods on the quality and bioactive compounds of broccoli stems</title>

Ultrasound pretreatment combined with vacuum freeze drying is beneficial for commercial quality maintenance and nutritional value enhancement, thus providing new perspectives on the comprehensive utilisation of broccoli stems.

Summary
The effects of ultrasound (US) pretreatment combined with drying process on storage quality maintenance and bioactive compound accumulation of broccoli stems were investigated. Results indicated that US pretreatment (λ = 8.5 mm) delayed the decline of L* value and ascorbic acid content but inhibited the increase of a* and b* values, browning index, and microbial counts of fresh‐cut broccoli stems. Furthermore, the US application enhanced total phenolics content by activating phenylalanine ammonia‐lyase, cinnamate‐4‐hydroxylase, and 4‐coumarate‐CoA ligase in phenylpropane metabolism. Meanwhile, it also promoted γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) accumulation by upregulating activities of diamine oxidase, polyamine oxidase, and aminoaldehyde dehydrogenase in GABA shunt and polyamine degradation pathway, respectively, which in turn, accelerated the biosynthesis of GABA from polyamines and glutamate. In addition, compared with other three drying methods, the combined vacuum freeze drying (VFD) could further retain the sensory attributes and bioactive compounds to a maximum extent in dehydrated broccoli stems. Hence, current findings illustrated that US pretreatment combined with VFD process is beneficial for commercial quality maintenance and nutritional value enhancement, thus providing new perspectives on the comprehensive utilisation of broccoli stems.

Impact of germination in changing bioactive compounds, antioxidant activity and total digestible starch content of rice, maize, green gram and soy

Summary
Germination is a sustainable and economical process that can enhance the bioactivities of commonly consumed cereal and pulses, contributing to healthier diets. Its effectiveness in increasing bioactives depends on the germination conditions. This study examined the impact of varying germination periods (2, 4, 6, and 8 days) following 12 h of steeping on rice, maize, green gram, and soy, focusing on key bioactive compounds, including total polyphenols, flavonoids, and total digestible starch. Cereal and pulses germinated for eight days demonstrated a significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) total polyphenol and flavonoid content along with elevated antioxidant activity. Antioxidant activity strongly correlated to increased total polyphenol and flavonoid levels throughout the extended germination period. Moreover, the total digestible starch content (TDS) in rice, maize, and soy increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) because of the hydrolysis of starch molecules, while green gram showed twofold decrease in TDS, indicating the impact of germination on TDS content may differ across the type of cereal and pules. Using locally grown Sri Lankan grain varieties, such as rice, maize,green gram,and soy, this study fills the gap in existing database on the investigation of bioactive compounds and total digestible starch content, exploring the potential of germination of cereal and pulses to use in nutritionally rich products in the food and agriculture industry with a focus on sustainable food systems and healthier eating habits.

         <title>Comparing the activity and interactions of the antifungal protein PeAfpA with conventional fungicides and food preservatives against mycotoxigenic fungi</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9326-9335, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
PeAfpA is an antifungal protein produced by Penicillium expansum. In this study, the activity of this protein was compared with fungicides (imazalil and thiabendazole) and preservatives (calcium propionate, sodium, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate and natamycin). In addition, the effect of PeAfpA in combination with imazalil, thiabendazole, natamycin and potassium sorbate was studied. The results led to the conclusion that PeAfpA, alone or in combination, has great potential for treating fungal infections.

Summary
Prevention of fungal contamination and the occurrence of mycotoxins in food and feeds requires the development of new antifungal approaches. The antifungal proteins (AFPs) produced by some fungi provide great potential for the control of contaminating fungi. In the present study, the antifungal activity of the protein PeAfpA from Penicillium expansum was compared with fungicides used in post‐harvest control (imazalil and thiabendazole) and food preservatives (calcium propionate, sodium, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, and natamycin), against 23 fungal species belonging to the genera Penicillium, Fusarium, Byssochlamys, Aspergillus and Alternaria. In general, PeAfpA had the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) followed by natamycin, the fungicides, and the chemical preservatives. PeAfpA was able to completely inhibit the growth of all tested fungi at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 8 μg mL−1. In addition, we assessed the effects of PeAfpA in combination with imazalil, thiabendazole, natamycin, or potassium sorbate against four representative fungal species. Our results provide evidence for partial synergistic and additive effects between the protein PeAfpA and the other compounds tested. This study concludes that PeAfpA, alone or in combination with fungicides or food preservatives, has a great potential to prevent fungal contamination and reduce the required dosage of fungicides or chemical preservatives used in food conservation.

Spirogyra neglecta (Hassall) Kützing can be utilised as a potential ingredient with high nutritional value, being a good source of protein and fibre, and having a unique aroma.

Summary
The proximate composition, selected amino acid composition, and chemical constituents of Spirogyra neglecta (Hassall) Kützing, a freshwater algae collected from Phrae province, Thailand was investigated. It was found to be a good source of protein (29.42% dry wt. basis) and fibre (6.70% dry wt. basis). The total amino acid content was 2611.85 mg/100 g edible. The chemical constituents were characterised by GC–MS, which demonstrated that it contained phytol (62.10%), ethyl 5,8,11,14,17‐icosapentaenoate (8.55%) among others. Based on its chemical composition results, it could serve as a potential ingredient with high nutritional values in the food and nutraceutical industry. Furthermore, the descriptive sensory profile consisting of 17 descriptors, namely, green colour, glossy, filamentous, aroma (algae, grassy, fishy, and earthy), flavour (algae, grassy, fishy, and earthy), sweet, bitter, and texture (fibrousness and softness), mouthfeel (entire mouth‐coating), and aftertaste (astringent), were successfully developed to allow characterisation of the sensory quality of this algae.

         <title>Physicochemical, enzymatic and fermentation modifications improve resistant starch levels and prebiotic properties of porang (Amorphophallus oncophyllus) flour</title>

Physicochemical, enzymatic and fermentation modifications improve resistant starch levels and prebiotic properties of porang (Amorphophallus oncophyllus) flour.

Summary
Porang tubers (Amorphophallus oncophyllus) are one of the Araceae family plants, which naturally contain resistant starch (RS). The RS is able to provide health impacts such as reducing the glycaemic index (GI), preventing the formation of gallstones and cardiovascular disease, and increasing mineral absorption. This research aims to improve the RS and prebiotic properties of porang flour through physical, chemical, enzymatic and microbiological modifications. Research methods include modification with physical treatment of autoclaving‐cooling one and two cycles (AC‐1S and AC‐2S), microwave‐cooling (MWC), heat moisture treatment (HMT), annealing (ANN), chemical treatment with acid hydrolysis (HA), enzymatic treatment with pullulanase debranching (DP) and microbiological treatment with combined heating and cooling fermentation (FAC). The results showed that physical, chemical, enzymatic and fermentation modification techniques increased the characteristics of RS and the prebiotic properties of porang flour. The best modification method for porang flour was obtained in the DP treatment with the morphological characteristics of sharp‐surfaced granules, total starch 39.81%, amylose content 3.73%, amylopectin content 36.08%, reducing sugar content 16.31%, power digestibility 43.81%, very rapidly digestible starch (VRDS) 8.59%, rapidly digestible starch (RDS) 11.08%, slowly digestible starch (SDS) 23.60%, RS 56.73%, resistance to gastric acid 98.60%, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) viability 11.87 log cfu/ml, prebiotic effect 3.07, prebiotic index 2.46 and prebiotic activity 1.77.

         <title>Valorisation of cold plasma‐treated onion skin waste in chocolate production</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9368-9375, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Onion skin powder was subjected to cold plasma, and the changes in colour, water content, microbial count, total phenolic content, and antioxidant activity were investigated. Then, the cold plasma‐treated onion skin powder was valorised in chocolate production, and the total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, and sensory properties of the chocolate samples were evaluated.

Summary
Onion skin is generated in high amounts as food waste that is rich in bioactive components. Thus, the valorisation of onion skin waste in food production following suitable methods of treatment can be regarded as a sustainable strategy in terms of nutrition, economy, and environment. Skin waste from onions (Allium cepa) was ground and exposed to dielectric barrier discharge cold plasma (DBDCP) at 40 kV for either 0 or 30 min. Then the cold plasma‐treated onion skin powder (OSP) was added to chocolate at a concentration of 0%, 1%, or 2% (w/w). The DBDCP‐induced changes in the microbial load, colour, water content, total phenolic content (TPC), and antioxidant activity of OSP were assessed. The TPC, antioxidant activity, and sensory properties of the chocolate samples added with OSP were also monitored. Cold plasma treatment increased the TPC and antioxidant activity of OSP, but it did not affect the water content, colour, and microbial load. The antioxidant activity and TPC of the chocolate samples incorporated with DBDCP‐treated OSP at a level of 2% were higher than the samples with or without untreated OSP. However, the samples with 2% DBDCP‐treated OSP demonstrated lower overall acceptability scores compared to samples without OSP. It can be said that cold plasma can be utilised in the treatment of onion skin waste and valorisation of cold plasma‐treated onion skin waste in the production of chocolate to improve its antioxidant properties. Future studies can focus on the enhancement of the sensory properties of onion skin‐added chocolate products.

         <title>Production of starch edible films using chitin nanocrystals extracted from mushroom</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9402-9416, December 2024. </description>

Chitin nanocrystals were extracted, characterised, and used as reinforcements for production of starch edible films to enhance their physical and mechanical properties.

Summary
This study aimed to produce chitin nanocrystals (CHNC) from mushroom and investigate their potential application in improving physicochemical properties of starch edible films. Alpha‐Chitin was extracted by demineralisation, deproteination, and discoloration treatments of mushroom powder, while CHNC were obtained by acid hydrolysis. Hydrolysis using hydrochloric acid for 120 min at concentration of 3 m was selected as the best conditions for CHNC. X‐ray Diffraction Analysis and Transmission Electron Microscopy showed a crystallinity index of 77 ± 1.2% and needle‐like morphology for CHNC with an average length of 81 nm and diameter of 19 nm. Chemical, morphological, and thermal properties of CHNC were characterised using FTIR, SEM, and DSC analysis and results indicated an increase of the purity of CHNC after hydrolysis. Different concentrations of CHNC (1, 3, 5, and 7% W/W) were used to produce a nanocomposite green film from corn starch. Quantification of the mechanical properties of the green films documented a direct relationship between CHNC concentration and the samples tensile strength and Young's modulus. However, increasing CHNC concentration resulted in a reduction in the samples' water vapour permeability, water solubility, and moisture absorption. The results of this study are promising, suggesting enhancements in the physicochemical properties of the edible film through CHNC incorporation.

         <title>Antithrombotic and ACE‐inhibitory activity of milk fermented by Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9417-9424, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Milk fermented by Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus NCFB 2772, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG, and a co‐culture of both strains exhibited increased in‐vitro antithrombotic and ACE‐I activities over time, with similar activity values across individual strains and the co‐culture. This increase in activities coincided with enhanced proteolysis.

Summary
In this work, the antihypertensive and antithrombotic activities of milk fermented with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus NCFB 2772 (monoculture and co‐culture), were studied. It was observed that both species, as well as the co‐culture, showed an increase in proteolytic activity during fermentation, which is related to the increase in the biological activities studied. Both biological activities increased as a function of fermentation time, describing a curve similar to that of their proteolytic activity, which could indicate the release of bioactive peptides due to the proteolytic activity of the bacteria. The highest antihypertensive activity was obtained at 12 h of fermentation and was 74.9% for Lb. rhamnosus, 79.1% for L. delbrueckii and 77.6% for the co‐culture, with no significant difference between these values. On the other hand, the antithrombotic activity was 56.1% for Lb. rhamnosus, 49.9% for L. delbrueckii and 72.3% for the co‐culture. These findings contribute to the knowledge about the influence of fermentation conditions on biological activity of fermented milk, while emphasising the additional benefits of probiotic and industrially important lactic acid bacteria.

&lt;p&gt;Milk fermented by &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus delbrueckii&lt;/i&gt; ssp. &lt;i&gt;bulgaricus&lt;/i&gt; NCFB 2772, &lt;i&gt;Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus&lt;/i&gt; GG, and a co-culture of both strains exhibited increased &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; antithrombotic and ACE-I activities over time, with similar activity values across individual strains and the co-culture. This increase in activities coincided with enhanced proteolysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, the antihypertensive and antithrombotic activities of milk fermented with &lt;i&gt;Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus&lt;/i&gt; GG and &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus delbrueckii&lt;/i&gt; ssp. &lt;i&gt;Bulgaricus&lt;/i&gt; NCFB 2772 (monoculture and co-culture), were studied. It was observed that both species, as well as the co-culture, showed an increase in proteolytic activity during fermentation, which is related to the increase in the biological activities studied. Both biological activities increased as a function of fermentation time, describing a curve similar to that of their proteolytic activity, which could indicate the release of bioactive peptides due to the proteolytic activity of the bacteria. The highest antihypertensive activity was obtained at 12 h of fermentation and was 74.9% for &lt;i&gt;Lb. rhamnosus&lt;/i&gt;, 79.1% for &lt;i&gt;L. delbrueckii&lt;/i&gt; and 77.6% for the co-culture, with no significant difference between these values. On the other hand, the antithrombotic activity was 56.1% for &lt;i&gt;Lb. rhamnosus&lt;/i&gt;, 49.9% for &lt;i&gt;L. delbrueckii&lt;/i&gt; and 72.3% for the co-culture. These findings contribute to the knowledge about the influence of fermentation conditions on biological activity of fermented milk, while emphasising the additional benefits of probiotic and industrially important lactic acid bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effect of ball‐milling treatment on the structural and functional characteristics of Litopenaeus vannamei protein</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9425-9436, December 2024. </description>

Ball‐milling treatment reduced the particle size of LVP and enhanced digestibility. Ball‐milling treatment improved the foaming and oil‐holding properties of LVP. The tertiary structure of BLVP was closely related to improved properties.

Summary
Ball‐milling is increasingly recognised as an efficient and environmentally friendly physical modification method in food processing. In this study, natural Litopenaeus vannamei protein (LVP) was subjected to ball‐milling treatment for 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 min, respectively. Then, its structure and functional properties were investigated. Results indicated that proper ball‐milling treatment significantly enhanced the quality of LVP by influencing its structure. Specifically, ball‐milled LVP (BLVP) powder exhibited finer and brighter. BLVP subjected to 10 min demonstrated the highest solubility (22.80%), digestibility (64.50%) and foaming stability (93.69%), which were attributed to particle size and structure. BLVP processed for 15 min exhibited the highest oil holding capacity (1042.67%) and foaming capacity (17.11%), positively related to its surface hydrophobicity and sulfhydryl content. And its allergenicity decreased by 4.35%. These results provide a foundational framework for utilising ball‐milling to modify LVP, suggesting that this method may enhance the industrial applications of LVP.

         <title>Quality of fermented pumpkin beverages under different fermentation conditions by Lactobacillus plantarum FNCC 020</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9437-9444, December 2024. </description>

This study highlights the effects of LAB fermentation time and temperatures on the quality of fermented pumpkin beverages (FPB). The experiment revealed potential development of FPB as a functional product with increased organic acids while retaining carotenoids and maintaining physical appearances.

Summary
Development of health‐promoting natural products has received importance, and fermented pumpkin can be a viable option, mainly regarding its carotenoid contents. This study aimed to investigate the quality of fermented pumpkin beverages (FPB) under various fermentation conditions (control, T1 = 30 °C, 12 h; T2 = 30 °C, 18 h; T3 = 30 °C, 24 h; T4 = 40 °C, 12 h; T5 = 40 °C, 18 h; T6 = 40 °C, 24 h) by Lactobacillus plantarum. Cell count of lactic acid bacteria, pH, chemical quality (soluble solid, acidity, total sugar, total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity), carotenoid contents, and colour attributes (h*, chroma, L*, and yellowing index) of FPB samples were studied. As a result, LAB fermentation significantly affected acidity and total sugar of FPB samples, while it did not change pH and soluble solids significantly. Besides, carotenoid contents and colour attributes of FPB were not different during fermentation, indicating that L. plantarum fermentation retained carotenoids and maintained physical appearances. Regarding sugars and organic acids, their quantity changed due to fermentation and lactic acids increased greatly up to three times higher than control after 24 h of fermentation at 30 °C. Moreover, fermentation by L. plantarum improved total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity, and these may recommend FPB as a potential functional product.

         <title>The preservative effect of the black rice's cold, hot and ultrasonic ethanol extracts on the storage quality of beef patties</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9445-9458, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black rice is an excellent source of some bioactive compounds contributing to antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. The addition of black rice extracts to beef patties slowed down the pH and lipid oxidation and slightly retarded the bacterial growth during storage. Accordingly, black rice extracts at 7.5% can be used to protect beef patties from microbial spoilage and oxidation during cold storage.

Summary
This work aimed to determine the total anthocyanin and phenolic contents and antioxidant capacity of extracts of the black rice's cold, hot and ultrasonic‐assisted extracts and their preservative effect on the storage quality of beef patties. The three extracts exhibited high anthocyanin, phenolic content and antioxidant capacity, and they were used in beef patties at five treatments (negative control without extract, positive control with 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), 7.5% cold extract, 7.5% hot extract and 7.5% ultrasound‐assisted extract). Raw and cooked beef patties were tested at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 days of cold storage in aerobically packaged polyethylene containers regarding pH, oxidative stability, antioxidant capacity and microbial quality. While adding black rice extracts did not influence the proximate composition of raw samples (P &gt; 0.05), it slowed down the pH and lipid oxidation during storage and provided pH and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) stability in all final products. The BHT and treatments with extract indicated a higher 2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) value than the negative control. Also, the incorporation of black rice extracts slightly retarded bacterial growth. These results suggest that the black rice extracts at 7.5% can be used effectively to protect beef patties from microbial spoilage and oxidation during cold storage for 12 days.

This research is conducted on the wheat bran, oat flour, and Dictyophora indusiata with substitution of wheat flour to make noodle and find out the physical, chemical, sensorial, and in vitro digestibility of noodles.

Summary
Wheat bran, oat flour, and Dictyophora indusiata powder were used to substitute wheat flour in noodle production. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of wheat bran flour, oat flour, and Dictyophora indusiata powder on physical, chemical, sensorial, and in vitro digestibility of wheat noodles. Results indicated that the addition of wheat bran flour, oat flour, and Dictyophora indusiata powder decreased the lightness, chewiness, and the reducing sugar released during digestion of noodles, and their estimated glycaemic index. The viscosity value of noodles decreased with Dictyophora indusiata powder addition solely. The protein, and dietary fibre of wheat noodle increased at 10% Dictyophora indusiata powder, and 10% oat flour blended with wheat flour, and the estimated glycaemic index lowered significantly with the addition of 10% wheat bran flour, and 10% Dictyophora indusiata powder.

The cooking quality, sensory quality and correlations analysis of whole potato vermicelli with different additives.

Summary
To conform to the trend of whole‐food diets in recent years, whole potato powder has been used for the processing of extruded vermicelli. The effects of different additives, such as NaCl, citric acid and ethanol, on the cooking quality and sensory quality of whole potato vermicelli obtained via twin‐screw extrusion were investigated. The colour, gelatinisation properties, water absorption, cooking loss, texture profile analysis, scanning electron microscopy analysis and correlation analysis of the whole potato vermicelli were determined and discussed. The brightness of the whole potato vermicelli increased from 52.0 to 55.4 at 1% NaCl addition and increased from 52.0 to 54.9 at 0.8% citric acid addition, and the water absorption of the whole potato vermicelli increased from 83.1% to 159.1% at 0.4% citric acid addition and increased from 83.1% to 258.9% at 8% ethanol addition. The cooking loss of the whole potato vermicelli decreased from 5.3% to 5.1% at 8% ethanol addition, indicating that ethanol could improve the cooking quality of whole potato vermicelli. The texture properties of the whole potato vermicelli decreased with the addition of ethanol, and the ΔH of the whole potato vermicelli decreased from 3.7 to 1.8 J g−1 at 0.8% citric acid addition and decreased from 3.7 to 1.5 J g−1 at 8% ethanol addition, respectively. Moreover, the addition of ethanol was negatively correlated with the max force, break distance, stretching work, hardness, adhesiveness and chewiness of the whole potato vermicelli. The addition of NaCl was positively correlated with the peak gelatinisation temperature. All three additives affected the microstructure of the whole potato vermicelli, including roughening the cross section and increasing the number of pores. In this study, NaCl improved the gelatinisation properties of whole potato vermicelli, citric acid and ethanol improved the water absorption of the whole potato vermicelli, and citric acid improved the anti‐browning effects of the whole potato vermicelli.

         <title>Effect of enzymes on baking quality of wheat dough and storage quality of toast bread</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9479-9489, December 2024. </description>

Toast is a nutrient‐rich consumer staple with a unique taste. The effects of α‐amylase (FAM), lipase (LIP) and maltose amylase (MAM) on the quality of wheat dough and toasted bread were studied. The research results indicate that enzymes can delay retrogradation in toast to extend its shelf life.

Summary
Toast is a nutrient‐rich consumer staple with a unique taste. However, retrogradation affects its storage quality and shelf life. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of enzymes on the baking quality of wheat dough and the storage quality of baked bread. Fungal α‐amylase (FAM), lipase (LIP), and maltose amylase (MAM) were added to wheat dough under quadruple fermentation to evaluate their effects on the quality of wheat dough and toasted bread during storage. FAM reduced the water absorption and stability of wheat flour, whereas LIP and MAM improved its properties. Moreover, all three enzymes increased the fermentation height and gas‐holding capacity of the dough, resulting in toast with a larger specific volume and low hardness. Toast containing 15 mg kg−1 MAM had the highest number of air holes and the best elasticity. Furthermore, 9 mg kg−1 FAM, 45 mg kg−1 LIP, and 15 mg kg−1 MAM retarded the retrogradation of toast during storage, reduced its hardness, and decreased the short‐range order and relative crystallinity. These findings indicate that enzymes can delay retrogradation in toast to extend its shelf life. These results further suggest that enzymes inhibit recrystallisation to delay toast ageing. Thus, this study provides theoretical references for the practical application of enzymes in bakery products.

         <title>Effect of superfine grinding mulberry leaves (Morus alba Linn.) powder on biscuit properties</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9500-9511, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superfine and regular grinding methods were used to mill mulberry leaves, and the chemical composition and physical characteristics of the powders were investigated. Both ML powders were substituted for flour at various percentages, and their effects on the biscuits' textural qualities and sensory assessment were examined.

Summary
Superfine and regular grinding methods were used to mill mulberry leaves (ML), and the chemical composition and physical characteristics of the powders were investigated. Compared to regular grinding, superfine grinding reduced particle size from 121.44 μm to 18.69 μm. Compared to coarse mulberry leaf (CML), the fine mulberry leaf (FML) powder had a greater water solubility index, soluble dietary fibre content and 1‐deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) content. Both types of ML powders were substituted for flour at various percentages (3%, 6%, 9% and 12%), and their effects on the biscuits' textural qualities and sensory assessment were examined. The adhesiveness, cohesiveness and springiness of biscuit doughs were all reduced by ML powder addition, while their hardness was raised. The inclusion of ML powders increased the hardness of the biscuits significantly, whereas only the addition of FML powders decreased their fracturability. Additionally, the DNJ contents in FML biscuits were significantly higher than that in CML biscuits. The sensory assessment revealed that biscuits containing 9% FML powder received the best rating.

Development of mushroom enriched multigrain bread.

Summary
Multigrain bread being nutritionally rich and convenient is one of the popular dietary options these days, particularly among urban dwellers. In this study, the effects of oyster mushroom powder (0–10%) supplementation on the nutritional, antioxidant, physical, textural, microstructural, and sensory attributes of multigrain bread were explored. Results showed a significant (P &lt; 0.05) enhancement in the bread's nutritional profile, with increased levels of protein, fibre, vitamin D, iron, potassium, manganese, and zinc, along with improved antioxidant properties. Microstructural analysis revealed that mushroom powder caused rougher and more inhomogeneous starch granules in the crumb. Although the incorporation of mushroom powder led to denser, harder, and more fragile bread, as indicated by physical and textural changes, sensory evaluation indicated that up to 5% supplementation did not negatively impact consumer acceptability (P &gt; 0.05). These findings suggest that oyster mushroom powder can be a beneficial functional ingredient in multigrain bread, enhancing its nutritional value while maintaining sensory quality.

         <title>Exopolysaccharides from Weissella cibaria isolated from oats: isolation, characterisation and its application in improving the texture of set‐type yogurt</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9532-9546, December 2024. </description>

In this study, lactic acid bacteria were isolated from oat and identified as Weissella cibaria with high probiotic activity and good tolerance to the alkaline environment of the intestine. W. cibaria was then used as a producer for the production of exopolysaccharides which were applied as a stabilizer in set‐type yoghurt (ex situ) in comparison with a mixed culture of traditional yoghurt starter culture and W. cibaria (in situ).

Summary
In this study, a lactic acid bacteria strain isolated from oats was used as a producer to obtain exopolysaccharide (EPS) using MRS agar plates. The findings indicated that the bacterial strain identified as Weissella cibaria (accession number: PP515290) was shown to have good probiotic activity, adapt better to alkaline than acidic conditions, and efficiently produce EPS at concentrations of up to 7.93 g L−1. SEM images showed a smooth surface and compact particle whereas FTIR confirmed the basic functional groups of polysaccharides in the sample. Meanwhile, XRD analysis demonstrated a non‐crystalline amorphous structure and thermal analysis indicated two‐phase thermal decomposition with maximum rate at 210 °C. Subsequently, EPS from W. cibaria was applied as stabiliser in set‐type yogurt (ex situ) in comparison with yogurt using mixed culture with W. cibaria (in situ) and traditional starter culture (control). The results showed that the addition of 2% EPS significantly improved syneresis (14.31%) compared to co‐culture (27.50%) and control (29.80%) as well as increased hardness of yogurt during 2‐week refrigeration.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, a lactic acid bacteria strain isolated from oats was used as a producer to obtain exopolysaccharide (EPS) using MRS agar plates. The findings indicated that the bacterial strain identified as &lt;i&gt;Weissella cibaria&lt;/i&gt; (accession number: &lt;a target="_blank"
   class="accessionId"
   href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/PP515290"
   title="Link to external resource: PP515290"&gt;PP515290&lt;/a&gt;) was shown to have good probiotic activity, adapt better to alkaline than acidic conditions, and efficiently produce EPS at concentrations of up to 7.93 g L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. SEM images showed a smooth surface and compact particle whereas FTIR confirmed the basic functional groups of polysaccharides in the sample. Meanwhile, XRD analysis demonstrated a non-crystalline amorphous structure and thermal analysis indicated two-phase thermal decomposition with maximum rate at 210 °C. Subsequently, EPS from &lt;i&gt;W. cibaria&lt;/i&gt; was applied as stabiliser in set-type yogurt (&lt;i&gt;ex situ&lt;/i&gt;) in comparison with yogurt using mixed culture with &lt;i&gt;W. cibaria&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;) and traditional starter culture (control). The results showed that the addition of 2% EPS significantly improved syneresis (14.31%) compared to co-culture (27.50%) and control (29.80%) as well as increased hardness of yogurt during 2-week refrigeration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Explanatory variables for prediction of sugars and organic acids in processed mangoes.

Summary
The quality of processed products can be adversely affected by uncontrollable batches of mangoes, which exhibit heterogeneous characteristics. This study aimed to establish predictive models for sugar and organic acid contents (dependent variables) in processed products using the initial compositions of fresh mangoes. Three mango cultivars (cv. ‘Kent’, cv. ‘Keo Romeat’, and cv. ‘Keo Chen’) were classified as low‐density and high‐density groups. Each group of mangoes at the green‐mature, mid‐ripe, and ripe stages was processed into pasteurised purees, dried slices, and mango chips. Prediction models were established using a mix of simple linear regression (SLR) based on the initial content and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to identify the impact of qualitative variables (ripening stage, cultivar‐density, and processing technique). In processed mangoes, 13% sucrose content was estimated to accumulate with the three qualitative variables, whereas glucose and fructose contents decreased from their initial levels by 10% and 7%, respectively. Processing techniques can predict the ratio of sugars/acids (S/A) in processed products, regardless of the ripening stage or cultivar‐density. Similar to S/A, citric acid and malic acid contents in mango products were significantly increased by processing techniques. The initial content and processes were insufficient to predict the final contents of the same parameters in processed mangoes; therefore, some models need to include the effects of ripening stage and cultivar‐density to improve the prediction. These relevant explanatory variables contributed significantly to the development of the models, resulting the accuracy of predictive models with normalised root mean square errors (NRMSEs) lower than 10%, except for malic acid (14.04%). In conclusion, it is feasible to estimate the sugar and acidity levels in processed mangoes, offering promising possibilities for ensuring consistent quality of mango‐based products.

Summary
Meat reduction, rather than total elimination, is emerging as a popular trend that fulfils most consumer demands. In this study, using survey results from 802 United Kingdom residents, we identified distinct groups of consumers based on their meat consumption habits and explored their attitudes towards meat reduction and their perception of hybrid meat products. Two distinct consumer segments were identified, named ‘fans’ and ‘reducers’. ‘Fans’ were unwilling to reduce their meat consumption, considering it a right that makes them feel good. They were more optimistic regarding environmental concerns and less enthusiastic about the idea of hybrid meat products. On the other hand, ‘reducers’, although they consumed meat, expressed feeling bad about it and reported high levels of environmental concerns. These differences were also reflected in their willingness to eat and buy hybrid meat products, as well as the desired type of meat and meat‐to‐plant‐based ratio in their chosen hybrid meat.

         <title>Application of yellow mustard gum in preparation of egg‐free mayonnaise</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 8972-8982, December 2024. </description>

Yellow mustard gum (YMG), an emerging natural hydrocolloid extracted from yellow mustard seed by‐products, showcases significant commercial potential. This study used YMG to develop egg‐free vegan mayonnaise, characterising its stability, texture, microstructure, and sensory properties, which were comparable or superior to commercial counterparts.

Summary
Yellow mustard gum (YMG) is a natural hydrocolloid extracted from the viscous fraction of the seed coat, a by‐product of mustard seeds, and possesses superior emulsifying capacity in emulsions. However, there is no application of YMG for commercial products. The demand for vegan mayonnaise (VM) has increased in recent years and the challenge is to maintain the original consistency and taste while replacing eggs from conventional mayonnaise. To obtain high‐quality VM and to investigate the potential of YMG as a food additive, YMG was applied to VM at 0%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8%, and 1.0% (w/w) in this study. The physical properties (index of stability, rheological properties and particle size characterisation), storage stability (visual stability, microstructure observation and cold tolerance) and texture of YMG‐formulated VM were measured and compared with commercial products to assess the quality and market prospects. The results showed that the VM obtained higher stability, more non‐Newtonian flow behaviour, and a smaller droplet size with higher YMG content. After 90 days of storage, no separation occurred in the YMG‐added VM. YMG improves the shelf‐life of VM, and mayonnaise formulated with YMG has comparative or better texture properties compared with commercial counterparts. Overall, YMG‐added VM could be more appealing to consumers favouring plant‐based foods and have the potential to substitute for traditional products. YMG is beneficial to vegan product development with clean‐label requirements.

         <title>Improvement of functional properties of Chlorella‐inulin conjugates via Maillard reaction</title>

The study employes glycation via Maillard reaction as means to bring about improvenemt in Chlorella. Modification step was followed by characterisation and functional properties assessment.

Summary
Functionalities of proteins for the formulation of protein‐fortified products are crucial, impacting the use of protein from sustainable sources such as algae. Glycation (the initial step of the Maillard browning reaction) is a standout modification technique explored to improve the functions of the protein in the food matrices. In this study, Chlorella powder was conjugated with inulin using a wet glycation method. It is a quick, scalable and easy method for improving the functionality of food proteins. In this study, conjugation was performed for three different Chlorella to inulin molar ratios (S1:1, S3:1 and S5:1). The solution of each molar ratio was heated at 90°C for 30 min under alkaline state (9.0 pH). Characterisation was conducted employing OPA assay, browning intensity and FTIR spectroscopy techniques. The results suggested glycation achieved the highest for the Chlorella‐inulin ratio of 1:1. Glycation extent influenced the solubility of this conjugate significantly (P &lt; 0.05) under an acidic medium. Other functional properties including hydration, moisture uptake, oil‐binding and emulsifying activity were also significantly (P &lt; 0.05) enhanced compared to unmodified Chlorella powder. Chlorella conjugate with molar ratio 1:1 also displayed higher antioxidant properties suggesting glycation's role in improving Chlorella powder free radical scavenging capabilities (1.25‐fold increase) and reducing power (2.24‐fold increase). The total scavenging activity and total reducing power of S1:1 were 2.526 × 10−3 and 1.872 × 10−3 mg mL−1 mg−1(Trolox Eq.), respectively. The results provide an understanding of different functionalities for glycated conjugates promising utilisation in the food and beverage industry.

         <title>Application of yellow mustard gum‐fenugreek mixed gum in preparation of non‐dairy fat whipping cream</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 8998-9008, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Yellow mustard gum has been found to synergistically interact with galactomannans, fenugreek gum, forming higher viscosity paste with lower total gum concentration. However, these blends have not been applied commercially. This study first tests the feasibility of adding this blend to stabilise and improve the texture of vegetable fat‐based aerated emulsions, whipping cream, expanding its use in clean label food products.

Summary
Yellow mustard gum (YMG) and fenugreek gum (FG) are both natural hydrocolloids derived from plant seeds. They showed synergistic effects of increased viscosity upon mixing thus expanding their applications. In this study, a synergistic YMG‐FG (7:3) blend of different total gum concentrations (0%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.15%, 0.2% and 0.25%, w/w) was used to develop a whipping cream formula with dairy fat replaced by palm kernel oil. Whipping creams of both liquid emulsion and whipped cream were characterised in terms of particle size, rheological properties, whippability and foam stability, texture and microstructure. The liquid emulsion before whipping showed a shear‐thinning behaviour regardless of the gum concentration. Upon whipping, the overrun of whipped cream decreased while the foam stability increased with increasing gum mixture content. The whipped cream with the addition of gum mixture retained the shape after storing overnight at 22 °C in comparison with two collapsed commercial samples. The whipped cream with 0.1% gum mixture exhibited optimal foam stability and textural properties among all the samples. Overall, the synergistic blend of YMG‐FG can be used as a natural stabiliser in formulating non‐dairy fat whipping cream products to improve foam stability and airy/fluffy texture.

         <title>Study on changes of bioactive substances and flavour characteristics during fermentation of jujube vinegar</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9009-9019, December 2024. </description>

In this study, jujubes were used as raw materials to produce jujube vinegar by using microbial fermentation technology, and the dynamic changes of bioactive components and flavour substances during the fermentation process were investigated. This study aimed to produce vinegar with functional properties from jujubes.

Summary
Jujubes are an excellent source of sugar and nutrients, making them well‐suited for fermentation. Previous research on jujubes has primarily focused on their use in fermented beverages and fruit wines, but their potential for vinegar production has not been sufficiently explored. Therefore, this study produced jujube vinegar from jujube as raw material using microbial fermentation technology, and the changes in bioactive substances and volatile components during different fermentation stages were monitored. Results revealed that the primary organic acids in jujube vinegar were acetic acid, malic acid and lactic acid. The levels of phenolic compounds, such as epicatechin and ferulic acid, increased significantly by 3.5‐fold and 3.2‐fold, respectively, after acetic fermentation, resulting in an improvement in antioxidant activity. In addition, a total of seventy‐three volatile substances were detected in jujube vinegar, with acids accounting for 72.13% of the overall content. Isoamyl alcohol, ethyl phenylacetate, benzaldehyde and 3‐hydroxy‐2‐butanone were also the principal flavour compounds of jujube vinegar, which are the main source of its intense flavour. This study reveals the dynamic law of nutrients and flavour compounds during the fermentation process of jujube vinegar. The findings provide a theoretical reference and practical basis for the production of jujube vinegar.

         <title>Rheological properties and in vitro digestibility of chicken breast myofibrillar protein containing various psyllium (Plantago ovata) husk concentrations</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9029-9038, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gelation properties and protein digestibility were improved with an increased level of psyllium husk powder (≤1.5%) in the myofibrillar protein extracted from chicken breast.

Summary
Most dietary fibres improved rheological properties but negatively impacted digestibility. However, the effect of psyllium husk powder (PHP) on digestibility has not been yet reported. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the rheological properties and digestibility of chicken myofibrillar protein (MP) containing different concentrations of PHP (0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%) at 0.45 m NaCl. To assess the rheological properties of MP, viscosity, hydrophobicity, disulphide bond, SDS–PAGE, cooking yield and gel strength were evaluated. The addition of PHP enhanced water retention capacity and protein–protein interactions in the MP system. To evaluate the effect of PHP on digestibility, protein digestibility, SDS–PAGE and microstructure observations were performed. It was confirmed that the addition of PHP improved the protein digestibility of MP by measuring the differences in protein content (%). Therefore, the addition of PHP into MP gel improved not only the rheological properties but also the protein digestibility during in vitro digestion.

         <title>Regulatory‐based classification of rums: a chemometric and machine learning analysis</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9072-9083, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The classification of four types of rums was achieved via machine learning models using the NTC278 standards parameters, and avoiding the implementation of new methods. Acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, and total acidity were key differentiators. This paves the way for a rapid identification sensor for The Industria Licorera de Caldas rums.

Summary
The Industria Licorera de Caldas (ILC) stands as a major liquor factory in Colombia, specialising in the production of various rum types including Tradicional, Juan de la Cruz, Carta de Oro, and Reserva Especial. These rums, as congeneric drinks, are known for their rich content of volatile compounds that define their sensory characteristics. To be commercialised, each rum batch must comply with Colombian standard NTC278 which defines rigorous assessment of congener content and various physicochemical parameters. Thus, the ILC has accumulated a vast amount of data over the years. This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of ILC rums, using chemometric techniques and machine‐learning classification models such as PCA, KNN, LDA, and RF. The aim was to distinguish between rum types based on parameters specified for standard compliance, streamlining the process without the need for additional or extensive new methodologies. As a result, through PCA data exploration, it was revealed that acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, and isobutanol levels are instrumental in differentiating rum variants. Similarly, all classification models achieved accuracy levels exceeding 0.83 and precision surpassing 0.93. These findings pave the way for further research in the development of an ILC‐specific sensor for rapid and reliable liquor authenticity testing.

         <title>Comparing gluten‐free eggless muffins' viscoelastic, rheological, and textural properties after combining seven plant‐based protein isolates with wheat, corn, and rice starches</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9096-9107, December 2024. </description>

Comparing the effect of blending of protein isolates from plant source with wheat corn and rice starches to evaluate the viscoelastic, rheological, textural characteristics of gluten free eggless muffins.

Summary
This study aimed to substitute egg albumin with eight plant‐based protein isolates and xanthan gum for the development of gluten‐free, eggless muffins. The presence of protein isolates led to reduced pasting viscosities, suggesting limited swelling capacity of the starch granules. Incorporating different protein isolates enhanced the batter's viscoelastic properties, marked by an increase in storage and loss modulus and a decrease in tan δ, indicating enhanced gel properties compared to starch‐only batters, which showed more liquid‐like characteristics. Consequently, the muffins exhibited greater specific volume, springiness, and cohesiveness. The consistency of the muffins varied depending on the protein isolates used. The inclusion of protein isolates also altered the crust's hue, shifting it towards a reddish‐brown shade, while the crumb colour varied with protein incorporated. Sensory evaluation demonstrated that overall acceptability of the muffins improved with the protein isolates, particularly for those incorporating mung bean protein isolate. Principal Component Analysis further highlighted the strong associations between specific quality attributes, underscoring the significant impact of protein isolates on the quality characteristics of gluten‐free muffins.

         <title>Purification and characterisation of a homogenised protein from Red Deer (Cervus elaphus) abomasum as a potential hyaluronidase inhibitor</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9108-9116, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a protein hyaluronidase inhibitor with antioxidant activity was identified for the first time from the ruminant abomasum using red deer abomasum. The structure of the protein was analysed, and the process of its inhibitory reaction was initially investigated.

Summary
To improve the utilisation of abomasum and explore the material basis of its antioxidant and hyaluronidase inhibitory activities, a homogeneous protein RDA4‐1 was isolated from the abomasum of cultured red deer by two‐step chromatography process for the first time in this study. It has a molecular weight of 15 kDa and comprises 43.56% essential amino acids. RDA4‐1 scavenged 50.97% of DPPH• and 88.37% of ABTS+· at 1.5 mg mL−1, and inhibited hyaluronidase by 79.23% at 1 mg mL−1. The CD and fluorescence spectroscopy was used to initiate explore the hyaluronidase inhibition reaction process. With an increase in the concentration of RDA4‐1 in the inhibition reaction, the wavelength of the negative peak of CD shifted from 208 to 218 nm, and the absorption of the positive peak of CD increased from 0.5 to 8.3 mdeg. Furthermore, fluorescence absorption at a wavelength of 340 nm rose from 248 to 762 au. These findings suggest that the interaction of RDA4‐1 with hyaluronidase induces alterations in the secondary structure of the protein complex, and RDA4‐1 binds reversibly to the enzyme in a non‐covalent manner. The results of this study indicate that RDA4‐1 could serve as a potential hyaluronidase inhibitor in the development of nutraceuticals.

         <title>Microwave‐assisted treatment for the improvement of rice flour properties and rice flour bread quality</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9157-9169, December 2024. </description>

Microwave treatment improves rice flour properties, as shown by TG/DTG curves, FT‐IR/XRD spectra, SEM images and enhanced bread quality.

Summary
Modification of rice flour by microwave and its effect on bread making performance was evaluated. Rice flour having two different water content (20% and 30%) were exposed to different level of microwave power (600 W, 700 W and 800 W) with 8 min treatment time to assess its influence on amylose content, thermal properties, morphological structure, functional and crystalline structural that affect bread quality. Microwave‐treated rice flour at 600 W showed notable increment in amylose content of 1.03 folds (for both 20% and 30% water content) as compared to untreated rice flour. The microwave treatment destroyed the amorphous region of the rice flour starch, whereas starch crystal structure was slightly increased after treatment. Rice flour maintained its thermal stability even after exposure to high radiation of microwave. The treated rice flour exhibited starch granules with more voids on its surface, indicating the exudation of amylose at higher temperature. The major effect of microwave treatment was observed on the bread for rice flour treated at 800 W with higher specific volume, increase in gas cells pores, softer crumb, low hardness and delayed staling as compared to untreated rice flour. The microwave‐assisted treatment shows a significant potential in improving the rice flour quality led to increase the quality of bread.

         <title>High prevalence of avian adapted CC5 Staphylococcus aureus isolates in poultry meat in Spain: food chain as vehicle of MRSA and MSSA CC398‐t1451</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9180-9188, December 2024. </description>

The food chain can be a vehicle for the transmission of Staphylococcus aureus clonal lineages associated with animals such as CC5 (mainly associated with poultry) and CC398 (mainly with pigs).

Summary
Staphylococcus aureus can cause food poisoning and human infections and CC5 and CC398 are relevant lineages in the animal‐human interface. The objective was to determine the S. aureus prevalence in chicken‐derived food, and to study the diversity of lineages, and their antimicrobial resistance and virulence genotypes. Sixty poultry‐food samples were processed, and the S. aureus isolates obtained were characterised. Antibiotic susceptibility was performed and the presence of resistance/virulence genes, and avian mobile genetic elements (MGEs) was studied. Forty‐four non‐repetitive S. aureus isolates were obtained of 28/60 samples (46.7%), and 43 methicillin‐susceptible (MSSA) and one methicillin‐resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates were detected. Five S. aureus isolates were multidrug‐resistant and 50% of isolates showed susceptibility to all tested antibiotics. Eighteen spa‐types, 11 sequence‐types and 8 clonal‐complexes were identified in the S. aureus collection. Three CC398 isolates (2 MSSA/1 MRSA) of spa‐type‐t1451 were detected, and MSSA‐CC398 isolates harboured the scn‐gene (absent in MRSA‐CC398). CC5 was the most frequent lineage identified (56.8%), all MSSA, and 56.7% of them contained avian‐MGEs. A high prevalence of avian‐adapted MSSA‐CC5 isolates was detected. Poultry meat has been shown to be a vehicle for CC398‐t1451 isolates, both MRSA and MSSA, showing characteristics of the animal and human clades, respectively.

         <title>Synergistic effects of alkaline and heat treatments on structural and functional properties of mung bean protein isolate: improving physicochemical stability of plant‐based emulsions</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9203-9219, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potential synergistic effects of 0.3% Na2CO3 and heat treatments on MBPI impacted the interfacial behaviour of MBPI by alteration of protein conformation and hydrophobic interactions, along with decreasing particle sizes. These treatments could enhance the protein's functional properties, enabling the development of stable plant‐based emulsion gels as fat replacers.

Summary
Plant‐based meat alternatives often require fat replacers to mimic the texture of traditional products. This study aimed to develop plant‐based emulsion gels using mung bean protein isolate (MBPI) as a potential fat substitute. However, creating these gels via heat setting requires a high protein concentration, which demands modification of the MBPI structure to enhance emulsifying properties. This study investigated synergistic effects of alkaline treatment (0.3 or 3.5% Na2CO3) and heat treatments (40 or 70 °C) on the functional properties of MBPI at high protein levels, for potential application as a plant‐based emulsion. The combined treatments reduced the zeta potential of protein suspensions from −9 to −19 mV and altered the protein conformation to form smaller particles (from 426 to 166 μm) with increased β‐sheet content. These treatments improved dispersibility of 8% MBPI suspension (58 to 86%), emulsifying activity index (6.34–10.89 m2 g−1), and stability coefficient (43 to 96%). Notably, MBPI samples treated with 0.3% Na2CO3 at 40 and 70 °C exhibited excellent emulsifying properties, forming stable monolayers at the oil–water interface, likely due to the increased surface activity of MBPI. Increasing protein concentration to 11% facilitated heat‐set gel formation; however, addition of 3.5%‐Na2CO3 induced premature gelation, limiting its application in emulsions. At 0.3%‐Na2CO3, increasing the protein content from 8% to 11% and the oil content from 10% to 30% further reduced emulsion droplet size, especially for MBPI treated with 0.3% Na2CO3 at 70 °C (MB‐0.3%‐70 °C) from 5.10 to 2.61 μm, likely due to decreased coalescence. This treatment yielded superior MBPI‐stabilised emulsion gels with enhanced penetration, fluid retention, and stability by possibly reducing protein aggregation. These findings demonstrate the potential of MBPI modified by combined addition of 0.3% Na2CO3 and heat treatment, particularly MB‐0.3%‐70 °C, as a promising ingredient for producing plant‐based emulsions.

         <title>Isolation and characterisation of zinc‐chelating peptides from tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) protein hydrolysate</title>

This is a novel piece of work investigating a zinc‐binding peptide produced from tilapia protein hydrolysis by multistage‐ultrafiltration technique. This creates the possibility of clarification of binding mechanisms between zinc and peptides as referred for high utilisation of tilapia.

Summary
This study aimed to isolate and characterise zinc‐chelating peptides from tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) protein hydrolysate. The hydrolysate was fractionated using a multi‐ultrafiltration technique, yielding peptide fractions with molecular weights between 0.5 and 5 kDa. These fractions were further purified using immobilised metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC‐Zn2+) and reverse high‐performance liquid chromatography (RP‐HPLC). Among the fractions obtained, the peptide fraction F211 exhibited a zinc‐binding capacity of 76.26 ± 2.46 mg g−1. Sequence analysis indicated that zinc binding occurred at amino acids on the F21 peptide and at valine or glutamate residues on the F22 peptide fraction. Structural characterisation revealed that amino nitrogen and oxygen atoms from carboxylate groups were the primary binding sites for Zn2+. Additionally, the zinc–peptide complex demonstrated strong thermal stability, which is significant for potential applications in food processing and storage, where maintaining the integrity of nutritional supplements under varying temperature conditions is crucial. These findings provide a feasible approach for the separation and purification of zinc‐binding peptides from tilapia protein hydrolysates and contribute to the understanding of the binding mechanisms between zinc and peptides.

         <title>Chemometric classification of Vietnamese green tea (Camellia sinensis) varieties and origins using elemental profiling and FTIR spectroscopy</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9234-9244, December 2024. </description>

An incorporated approach of ICP‐MS and FTIR spectroscopies, and PCA analysis can be used for distinctive interpretation in terms of geographical origins and varieties of green tea.

Summary
The objective of this study was to employ multi‐elemental analysis and chemometric multivariate data analysis for identifying the geographical origin of Camellia sinensis cultivated in Vietnam's northeastern region. Ninety‐two tea leaf samples encompassing four distinct varieties were sourced from Bac Can and Thai Nguyen provinces. These samples underwent analysis through Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and chemometrics, while elemental quantification was achieved via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP‐MS), utilising mixed standards for 26 elements. The FTIR spectra exhibited characteristic peaks, denoting the functional groups of the potential compounds present. ICP/MS analysis identified the presence of 14 elements in the tea samples, revealing significant variations in content across the four varieties. principal component analysis (PCA) of the FTIR data illustrated that the initial two principal components accounted for 91.26% of the total variance, effectively segregating the four green tea varieties into distinct clusters. Conversely, PCA of the ICP‐MS spectra also distinguished the four varieties, albeit Trung Du and Hybrid F1 exhibited a proximate distribution. This closeness may be incidental and not indicative of correlation, considering the limited variable set. Our findings ascertain that ICP/MS and FTIR, augmented by chemometric software, serve as efficacious tools for ascertaining the geographical origins of tea.

         <title>Development of eco‐friendly PVA blended aloe vera rind CNC films and fumigation of essential oils: a novel approach to prolonging the shelf‐life of white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus)</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9602-9614, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocomposite films (BCF) developed through solvent casting method by using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) obtained from Aloe vera rind. The biocomposite films with PVA+ 8% CNC exhibited enhanced mechanical strength and barrier properties, reducing moisture loss and oxygen transmission. Fumigation of essential oils in the optimised film demonstrated the superior antimicrobial properties by preserving the mushrooms’ freshness. This novel approach provided an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional packaging methods for prolonging the shelf‐life of white button mushrooms.

Summary
The white button mushroom is a significant vegan food with a limited shelf‐life. To prolong the shelf‐life of mushrooms, certain treatment must be implemented. The current investigation is involved in the development of biocomposite film (BCF) by employing cellulose nano crystal (CNC), dispersed in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix. The CNC extracted from aloe vera rind exhibited a sharp crystalline peak and rod‐shaped structures with a particle size of ~322.7 nm. Among the various concentrations of the CNC, incorporated in the BCF, the 8% CNC (BCF‐8%)‐loaded film showed the highest mechanical strength of ~166.73 MPa and a best crystallinity pattern. The study examined the synergistic impact of BCF along with neroli and palmarosa essential oil vapours, which effectively preserved the overall physiochemical properties and sensory characteristics of white button mushrooms for up to 8 days of storage. Hence, these innovative packaging systems are suitable substitute for the commercial food grade packaging to maintain the quality of mushrooms during postharvest storage.

Avocado oil and modified rice starch improve the physical‐chemical, sensory, and nutritional characteristics of gluten‐free cake.

Summary
This study aimed to use modified rice starch by heat‐moisture treatment with avocado oil (AO) in gluten‐free cakes. Four cake formulations were prepared with native or modified rice starch with AO or soybean oil (control). The cake's sensory, microbiological, technological, nutritional, and bioactive compound characteristics were analysed. All formulations were sensorily acceptable (acceptance index: 72.44% to 79.44%) and microbiologically safe. The cake formulated with modified starch and AO exhibited the best textural properties, softness, and colour, and demonstrated the lowest in vitro digestibility (81.52 ± 2.75%) and glycaemic index (88.04 ± 3.83). AO resulted in higher levels of phenolic compounds in the cake (112.91 ± 1.8 to 237.38 ± 4.1 mg EAG.100 g−1). The use of modified rice starch and AO showed greater potential in the application of gluten‐free cake than those with native starch, resulting in improved product characteristics and good technological and sensory properties. It has also become a promising alternative in gluten‐free food products.

         <title>Liposomal black mulberry extract loaded‐nanofibers: preparation, characterisation, and bioaccessibility of phenolics by simulated in vitro digestion combined with the Caco‐2 cell model</title>

Liposomal black mulberry‐loaded nanofibers: production, characterisation, and assessment of bioaccessibility.

Summary
Black mulberry extract (BME) is rich in phenolics; however, their health benefits are restricted by their instability and poor absorption in the small intestine. Liposomal BME‐loaded pullulan/pectin nanofibers were developed to enhance the in vitro bioaccessibility of BME. The liposomes with BME (0.8%, w/v), were produced by the thin‐film hydration and ultrasonication method with a size of 76.41 ± 1.23 nm and encapsulated 79.40 ± 0.99%.of the BME. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images showed that the uniform distribution of liposomes within the defect‐free fiber structure. Liposomal BME loading elevated the mucoadhesiveness of the nanofibers compared to free BME loading. Liposomal BME‐loaded nanofiber demonstrated a nearly two‐fold increase in the bioaccessibility of anthocyanins. The cellular release of all four different anthocyanins by Caco‐2 cells was significantly higher (3.92%–10.50%) in liposomal BME‐loaded nanofiber. Therefore, liposomal nanofibers show great potential as a method for delivering phenolics, specifically anthocyanins.

         <title>Effects of fortified electrolyte drink on cognitive, mood, and nutritional parameters: a randomised, single‐blind, placebo‐controlled study</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9345-9352, December 2024. </description>

This study examines the effects of a fortified electrolyte drink (FED) and an electrolyte drink (ED) on the cognitive, mood, and nutritional parameters of university students.

Summary
Electrolyte drinks contain charged minerals and are easily accessible in the market. It has become popular for the food and beverage industry to add nutrients and/or active ingredients to electrolyte drinks and market them as functional beverages. This study aims to determine the interactive effects of electrolyte drinks added caffeine, glucose, and B‐group vitamins (FED) on cognitive, mood index, and nutritional parameters. A total of 34 university students participated in this randomised, single‐blind, and placebo‐controlled study. Participants in the intervention group consumed 500 mL of FED, while participants in the control group consumed 500 mL of an electrolyte drink (ED). Baseline and post‐intervention data on cognitive performance, mood index, blood glucose, blood pressure, heart rate, and urine specific gravity were measured. Results indicated no significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) in post‐intervention cognitive performance scores for simple reaction time, choice reaction time, verbal paired associates, visual paired associates, and digit symbol matching between the FED and ED groups. Levels of fatigue, confusion, and total mood disturbance (TMD) were significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05) by 46.50%, 62.75%, and 9.54%, respectively, following FED consumption. Post‐intervention data indicated no differences between the FED and ED groups in blood pressure, heart rate, and urine specific gravity, except for the blood glucose parameter, in which the blood glucose level of the FED group was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) than that of the ED group. This study indicates that FED consumed in a realistic dose can reduce fatigue, confusion, and TMD. Further studies with a higher caffeine dosage, but within the safe range, could be conducted to investigate the cognitive enhancement potential of FED.

         <title>Antioxidant and antiglycating properties of ethanolic extracts from different parts of Neltuma ruscifolia pods</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9376-9384, December 2024. </description>

The graphical abstract illustrates the Neltuma ruscifolia pods, including powders and extracts obtained through agitation or high/low intensity ultrasound. Various assays indicate that these materials have potential for use as natural additives.

Summary
Neltuma ruscifolia, a neglected underutilised species (NUS) within the Fabaceae family, lacks formal commercial recognition, despite its nutritional richness and endemic status. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant and antiglycating properties, as well as to identify associated bioactive compounds, in extracts (ultrasound and agitation) of different grinding fractions of N. ruscifolia seeds. Bioactivity varied depending on the extraction procedure and milling fraction, with the highest value in ultrasound‐extracted residue (exocarp, mesocarp). Some additional polyphenolic compounds (like hydroxybenzoic/ellagic acids) only appeared upon ultrasound‐assisted extraction. It was possible to identify some polyphenols (such as chrysin, rutin, kaempferol and cinnamic, coumaric, protocatechuic, ellagic and caffeic acids) that were highly related to the bioactivity. The antioxidant, antiglycating, colourant and technological properties of the extracts different fractions of N. ruscifolia pods are mainly dependent on the selected milling fraction. The extraction method, in a second place, significantly affects the resulting quantity and the type of extracted compounds, defining their potential applications.

Schematic diagram of the experimental procedure.

Summary
This study examined the impact of CO2 on the quality of onions stored at 23 °C for 6 weeks, focussing on bioactive compounds, antioxidant capacity, individual anthocyanins, flavonoids and anthocyanin biosynthesis during the storage period. The findings revealed that a 20% CO2 treatment was markedly more effective than the control in maintaining higher levels of phenolics, flavonoids, flavanols and anthocyanins. Moreover, the 20% CO2 treatment preserved significantly higher quantities of individual anthocyanins and flavonoids compared to the control. Throughout storage, the 20% CO2 treatment significantly boosted the activity of enzymes related to anthocyanin biosynthesis and sucrose metabolism relative to the control groups. In summary, the innovation of this study lies in the use of CO2 to maximise anthocyanin and flavonoid content in stored onions, which are usually diminished by extended storage at room temperature. This method could help extend the shelf life of onions while preserving their quality attributes.

         <title>Effects of different oxidation methods on the functional properties and gel characteristics of hazelnut proteins</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9469-9478, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, proteins from hazelnuts were extracted and different oxidation methods were used to explore the effects on the functional and gel properties of hazelnut proteins.

Summary
This study aimed to investigate the effects of different oxidation modes on the functional and gel properties of hazelnut proteins. The solubility of hazelnut protein showed a small trend when the oxidation level was low, and it decreased significantly with the increase in concentration. The maximum value of water‐holding capacity (WHC), emulsifying activity index (EAI), and emulsion stability index (ESI) was 343.33%, 56.00 m2 g−1, and 75.85 min at AAPH concentration of 1.0 mmol L−1, respectively. The functional properties of hazelnut proteins, except oil‐holding capacity (OHC), gradually reduced with the increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration. H2O2 modified improved OHC, foaming capacity, foam stability, and EAI of hazelnut proteins, whereas WHC and ESI gradually decreased. The results of the secondary structure of hazelnut protein gels indicated a high ratio of α‐helix and β‐fold of the gels. Also, the increase in oxidation led to an increase in the gels' voids. Also, oxidation led to a rough and loose network structure of hazelnut protein gels. These results suggested that peroxyl radical, hydroxyl radical, and MDA produced during lipid peroxidation affected the interfacial properties of hazelnut protein and disrupted the formation of hazelnut protein gel, thus affecting the quality of hazelnut protein.

         <title>Dominance and diversity of archaea in food‐grade salts: insights for histamine degradation in salt‐fermented foods</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9490-9499, December 2024. </description>

Haloarchaea within the class Halobacteria represent the dominant microbial group in salts, exhibiting a distinct community composition that varies significantly between salts. Indigenous haloarchaea in salt can potentially serve as starter cultures for salt‐fermented foods, effectively maintaining low histamine levels.

Summary
Halophilic archaea (haloarchaea) are extremophilic microorganisms that thrive and dominate in hypersaline environments, including salt and salt‐fermented foods. Haloarchaea present in salt are integral to the safety of salt‐fermented foods. In this study, haloarchaeal communities in seven food‐grade coarse sea salts, commonly used in salt‐fermented food production, were studied. q‐PCR results showed that archaea represented the dominant group in all samples, with relative abundances above 83%. Archaeal 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing identified thirty‐three of the current eighty‐five genera within the class Halobacteria across the samples, revealing unique haloarchaeal community compositions. A total of 394 haloarchaeal strains, grouped into forty‐one species from twenty current genera and potentially novel taxa, were isolated. Archaeal community composition in all samples varied significantly among genera. Notably, a significant proportion of the haloarchaeal strains demonstrated histamine degradation capabilities, confirmed by bioinformatic analyses and culture‐based methods. Our results indicated that haloarchaea from salt can potentially serve as starter cultures for salt‐fermented foods, maintaining low histamine levels.

&lt;p&gt;Halophilic archaea (haloarchaea) are extremophilic microorganisms that thrive and dominate in hypersaline environments, including salt and salt-fermented foods. Haloarchaea present in salt are integral to the safety of salt-fermented foods. In this study, haloarchaeal communities in seven food-grade coarse sea salts, commonly used in salt-fermented food production, were studied. q-PCR results showed that archaea represented the dominant group in all samples, with relative abundances above 83%. Archaeal 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing identified thirty-three of the current eighty-five genera within the class &lt;i&gt;Halobacteria&lt;/i&gt; across the samples, revealing unique haloarchaeal community compositions. A total of 394 haloarchaeal strains, grouped into forty-one species from twenty current genera and potentially novel taxa, were isolated. Archaeal community composition in all samples varied significantly among genera. Notably, a significant proportion of the haloarchaeal strains demonstrated histamine degradation capabilities, confirmed by bioinformatic analyses and culture-based methods. Our results indicated that haloarchaea from salt can potentially serve as starter cultures for salt-fermented foods, maintaining low histamine levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Schematic Summary of the Study.

Summary
This study aims to develop a novel active food packaging material from hybrid micro‐nanofibrous mats fabricated from gelatin (G)–chitosan (Ch)–polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)–Origanum elongatum essential oil (EO), (G‐Ch‐PVA‐EO) through electro‐blowing. The fibrous mats were characterised to assess their morphologies, shelf life efficiency, antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, surface‐wetting, and thermal, chemical, and physical interactions, among other factors. Results showed that the antioxidant activity was improved with the addition of EO, this enhancement is potentially linked to its rich content of phenolic components; carvacrol and P‐cymene. In addition, G‐Ch‐PVA‐EO showed higher firmness measurements compared to the control samples. Herein, low microbial counts were noted for both mesophilic aerobic bacteria (3.76 log CFU g−1) and yeast/mould (3.91 log CFU g−1) even at day 20. To conclude, the G‐Ch‐PVA‐EO microfibrous mat exhibits great promise in preserving the freshness of tomatoes.

         <title>Antifungal efficacy of neroli and palmarosa essential oils against major white button mushroom postharvest pathogens</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9592-9601, December 2024. </description>

Neroli–palmarosa EOs inhibited the growth of T. lentinulae and R. arrhizus. Disease incidence and severity were effectively reduced in the EO treated mushroom. Major component in neroli and palmarosa EOs are linalool and geraniol respectively. Neroli–palmarosa EOs could be alternative natural fungicide to preserve mushroom.

Summary
White button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) has a wide nutritional benefit and a major drawback in supply chain management, due to its short shelf‐life of between 3 and 4 days. Postharvest spoilage caused by Trichoderma and Rhizopus including green‐mould and soft‐rot diseases causes an enormous impact on the shelf‐life of mushroom. Research work is designed to isolate the post‐harvest pathogens from mushroom and determine the effects of eight essential oils on the control of the major postharvest pathogens (T. lentinulae and R. arrhizus). Neroli and palmarosa exhibited 100% inhibition of the two pathogens at 3 and 4 μL/plate, respectively. In‐vivo studies showed that fumigation of neroli and palmarosa essential oils at concentrations of 46.2 and 61.6 μL L−1 exhibited a significant effect on the postharvest pathogens. Major components present in neroli and palmarosa are linalool and geraniol respectively. Findings concluded that neroli and palmarosa could be an efficient natural fungicide to reduce postharvest diseases in white button mushroom.

         <title>Sensory profile of cream cheese and plant‐based analogues: an approach through flash‐profile, CATA and RATA tests</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9084-9095, December 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sensory characteristics and instrumental texture of cream cheese analogues may present a barrier to their acceptance by consumers. The complexity of stabilising the physicochemical system of cream cheese and the importance of protein–fat interactions highlight the technological challenge in producing plant‐based cream cheese analogous to traditional formulations.

Summary
The distinct techno‐functional and sensory attributes conferred by milk proteins and fat are fundamental in defining the structure, texture and flavour of dairy products. Thus, reproducing cheese‐like characteristics in plant‐based alternatives while ensuring consumer acceptance is a major challenge. This study aimed to evaluate the sensory profile of commercial cream cheese and plant‐based analogues, quantifying consumer perception and discrimination, and correlating with instrumental texture analysis. For that, two milk‐based (MB1 and MB2) and three plant‐based products (PB1, PB2 and PB3) were evaluated for their proximate composition, texture profile (spreadability and firmness) and sensory properties by combining Flash Profile method (n = 13), Check‐All‐That‐Apply (CATA) test, and Rate‐all‐that‐apply (RATA) test (n = 102) with global acceptance. Milk‐based cream cheeses (MB1 and MB2) did not differ significantly from each other and presented greater spreadability when compared to all plant‐based cream cheeses (PB1, PB2 and PB3). The texture parameters of the samples were inversely related: the greater the firmness, the lower the spreadability. All forty‐two sensory attributes allowed discrimination of the samples into three distinct clusters, with no difference between the milk‐based products. The results of the CATA test showed that the attributes most correlated with the sample MB1 were the most desirable for good acceptance of the product. In turn, PB3 showed lower acceptance scores when compared to the plant‐based samples PB1 and PB2, and the attributes rancid flavour, vegetable oil aroma and nut aroma mostly contributed to the lower acceptance of PB3. Milk‐based products were very close to the ideal product, presenting a creamy and spreadable texture as key attributes for product characterisation and acceptance. The results of RATA test showed a significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) in the intensity of nineteen sensory attributes. Milk‐based cream cheeses were more accepted than their plant‐based counterparts. The instrumental assessments of firmness and spreadability exhibited a negative correlation, once they were inversely proportional and strongly correlated to sensory data of firm and spreadable texture, respectively. The sensory characteristics of cream cheese analogues may present a barrier to their acceptance by consumers. Attributes such as coconut and flour flavour, artificial cheese aroma and flavour, and spreadable texture played a key role in differentiating dairy products from plant‐based ones, contributing to the lower acceptance of the latter.

Screening of fermented milks with Lactococcus and Lactobacillus strains isolated from artisanal Mexican cheeses by evaluation of the in vitro inhibition of enzymes associated to neurodegeneration.

Summary
The objective was to evaluate the in vitro inhibition of enzymes related to neurodegeneration (prolyl endopeptidase, PEP; acetylcholinesterase, AChE; butyrylcholinesterase, BChE; lipoxygenase, LOX) and the antioxidant activity from fermented milks (FM) with Lactococcus and Lactobacillus spp. All FM presented antioxidant activity (ABTS and ORAC); however, FM with Lactococcus NRRL B‐50571 (FM‐571) presented higher (P &lt; 0.05) oxidative haemolysis inhibition. Additionally, FM‐571 presented the lowest IC₅₀ for LOX (1.78 mg/mL), PEP (3.16 mg/mL), AChE (3.22 mg/mL) and BChE (2.14 mg/mL). Thus, FM‐571 was selected for in silico analysis for the prediction of binding sites of peptides present in this FM with enzymes active sites. Altogether, thirty peptides showed (P &lt; 0.01) high binding potential to AChE, seventeen to BChE and LOX and sixteen to PEP. Thus, FM‐571 shows potential for the development of dairy products with potential neuroprotective effects.

Summary
Edible mushrooms have become an important global ingredient due to their rich nutrients and delicious taste. However, their high moisture content, abundant bioactive components and susceptibility to microbial contamination led to a relatively short shelf‐life. Therefore, extensive research on the active ingredients, bioactivity and preservation techniques of mushrooms is crucial for enhancing the rapid development and increasing acceptance of the mushroom industry. Furthermore, the comprehensive utilisation of by‐products from mushroom processing and the diversified development of mushroom products are important means to increase the added value of the mushroom industry. Therefore, through the aforementioned research, the sustainable and healthy development of the mushroom industry can be promoted.

         <title>Multitechnique approaches for characterising phase behaviour in food biopolymer systems</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9626-9645, December 2024. </description>

Diverse methods offer unique insights into the phase behaviour mechanism.

Summary
Understanding the phase behaviour of biopolymer composites is vital for various technological applications, such as developing functional foods, nutraceuticals, encapsulation, isolation and fractionation of enzymes and proteins. The growing consumer demand for healthier food products pressures the food and nutraceutical industries to innovate while maintaining traditional texture and nutritional quality. This review critically examines various analytical techniques, including spectroscopic, microscopic, calorimetric, rheological, viscometry, and diffraction methods, used to study phase behaviour. Each technique provides unique insights into phase behaviour mechanisms at micro and macroscopic levels, with respective advantages and limitations discussed. The review advocates for a multi‐technique approach for a comprehensive understanding of phase behaviour and highlights the development of in situ probing techniques with minimal sample pre‐processing as a promising advancement. These innovations are expected to significantly enhance the practical applications of these techniques in the food industry, meeting current consumer demands without compromising traditional qualities.

Factors shaping the future of antimicrobial edible packaging.

Summary
This article aimed at reviewing recent developments shaping the future of antimicrobial edible food packaging. The main issues discussed in the article are (i) factors (e.g. waste valorisation, sustainability, health and environmental concerns, religious concerns, etc.) causing emerging of alternative hydrocolloids extracted from farming/processing wastes of plants, animals, fungi, insects, snails, etc. as antimicrobial edible packaging material; (ii) emerging methods of manufacturing antimicrobial packaging (e.g. extruded and co‐extruded antimicrobial casings, antimicrobial electrospun mats, and electrosprayed films, coatings and particles); (iii) emerging concepts in using natural antimicrobials in edible packaging such as using narrow‐ or broad‐spectrum antimicrobials, synergetic mixtures, and controlled release strategies based on nanoencapsulation (e.g. Pickering emulsions, nanoemulsions, inclusion complexes, solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers). This review helps discovering the future of active edible packaging that is expected to play a central role in improving food safety and quality, human health and environmentally friendly practices.

         <title>Potential and application of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in the analysis and identification of novel bacteriocins: a review</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 8943-8960, December 2024. </description>

Summary
Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides synthesised ribosomally by Gram‐positive or Gram‐negative bacteria to gain a competitive advantage. The majority of bacteriocins are derived from Gram‐positive bacteria, with lactic acid bacteria being the most common source. Because they are considered ‘natural’, there is currently significant development of bacteriocins for application as food preservative agents. As a preservative agent, bacteriocin activity is highly dependent on purity, down to the amino acid profile and sequence. Therefore, bacteriocin identification is important. Currently, MS is a cutting‐edge tool in bacteriocin identification. This method has high selectivity, sensitivity and resolution. To the best of our knowledge, systematic reviews focusing on the application of MS for bacteriocin identification are currently limited. In light of this, the objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive review and summary of MS technologies in bacteriocin research, with a particular focus on the discovery and characterisation of novel sources of bacteriocin. Additionally, studies related to the discovery of bacteriocins from various sources, their role as antimicrobial agents, and their synthesis are emphasised. Thus, this study presents a comprehensive analysis of the advantages, limitations, and future perspectives of the methods employed.

         <title>Exploring the potential of mushrooms in ready‐to‐eat snack formulations</title>
         <description>International Journal of Food Science &amp;amp;Technology, Volume 59, Issue 12, Page 9562-9570, December 2024. </description>

The study explores the nutritional benefits of incorporating mushrooms into ready‐to‐eat (RTE) snacks and the advantages of extrusion, frying and baking in their production. Mushrooms are gaining popularity as a health‐boosting ingredient with disease‐fighting properties, making them ideal for healthier snacks. Research indicates that mushroom‐infused RTE snacks can cater to changing dietary preferences and enhance overall health.

Summary
Contemporary dining habits have spurred a shift in ready‐to‐eat (RTE) snack production, with mushrooms offering a nutritional boost due to their protein, carbohydrate, fibre and vitamin content. Proximate composition data aid in creating snacks with balanced nutrition. Mushrooms also contribute antioxidants and antimicrobial compounds, adding a health dimension. Extrusion cooking, known for adaptability and energy efficiency, improves texture, nutrition and shelf life. Though concerns exist about oil intake, frying remains popular for taste and consistency enhancement, requiring careful management. Baking extends shelf life and preserves flavour while enhancing nutrient availability. Various studies highlight the potential of these techniques to meet consumer preferences for convenient, appealing and health‐conscious snacks by incorporating ingredients like legume protein isolates, nuts and seeds, etc. The RTE snack industry evolves to provide healthier options driven by technological innovations and sustainability practices, with personalised and functional snacks on the horizon. The study aims to explore and highlight the nutritional benefits of incorporating mushrooms into RTE snacks and discusses the unique advantages of extrusion, frying and baking in snack production.

Summary
Flammulina velutipes (F. velutipes) is one of the most widely consumed edible mushrooms worldwide. The growth of F. velutipes involves two primary stages: the mycelium and fruiting body. Unique polysaccharides are produced in each stage; mycelial polysaccharides (FVMPs) are produced during the mycelial fermentation stage, while fruiting body polysaccharides (FVFBPs) are produced during the fruiting stage. These polysaccharides, the major bioactive components of F. velutipes, have garnered significant attention due to their various functions and activities. Notably, they exert functional activities by mediating gut flora, including antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties, reduce blood sugar and lipid levels, and enhance cognitive performance. This study examined the variations in FVMPs and FVFBPs resulting from different extraction and purification methods, with a specific focus on delineating their distinct structural characteristics. This study further explored the impact of the structural composition of FVMPs and FVFBPs on their health‐promoting properties, focusing on the relationship between their structures and their functional and biological effects. Finally, this study outlines future research avenues designed to contribute to the ongoing research in the field of bioactive FVMPs and FVFBPs.

Summary
Modernisation has significantly altered lifestyles, particularly eating habits, contributing to the increase of chronic diseases, with diabetes mellitus being a predominant metabolic disorder. Medicinal herbs such as Costus pictus (C. pictus), commonly known as the Insulin plant, offer a promising approach to managing these conditions. It is a perennial plant from the Costaceae family rich in proteins, fibres, minerals (K, Ca, Cr, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn), and bioactive compounds. This review highlighted the plant's potential in mitigating chronic diseases and metabolic disorders due to its diverse bioactivities, including hepatoprotective, anti‐inflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic, and antioxidant properties. These benefits are primarily attributed to its phytochemicals, mainly flavonoids and phenolic compounds. The antidiabetic mechanism involves suppressing metabolic enzymes essential for carbohydrate metabolism, while its antioxidant activity helps reduce excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels implicated in various diseases. Furthermore, C. pictus can be incorporated into functional foods such as bakery and confectionery products, functional drinks, and edible coatings. We discussed the dietary factors, bioactivities, and underlying mechanisms associated with Costus pictus D., emphasising its applicability in functional food formulations. The synthesis of current research highlights the plant's role in modulating glucose metabolism, enhancing antioxidant defences, and its potential in mitigating diseases such as diabetes. By delving into the synergies between its dietary factors and bioactivities, this review aims to elucidate the multifaceted benefits of Costus pictus D., thereby fostering its integration into sustainable agricultural practises and contributing to public health nutrition.
