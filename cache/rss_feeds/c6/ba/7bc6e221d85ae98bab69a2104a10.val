         <title>Prediction of Mild Moldy‐Core Disease in Apples Based on Fusion Features of Near‐Infrared Transmission Spectroscopy and Acoustic Vibration Signals</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
In response to the low accuracy of single‐method detection of mild moldy‐core in apples, a heterogeneous information fusion method based on near‐infrared transmission spectroscopy and acoustic vibration technology was proposed. For near‐infrared spectral signals, the impact of different preprocessing and feature extraction methods on the modeling performance was analyzed, and the optimal spectral feature bands were determined. For acoustic vibration signals, seven time‐domain features and six frequency‐domain features were selected using one‐way ANOVA. Subsequently, the spectral feature bands and acoustic vibration features were concatenated to form a fused feature vector. Support vector machines (SVM) were employed to construct discrimination models based on single‐source features and fused features, and different optimization algorithms were applied to optimize the parameters ‘c’ and ‘g.’ Model performance analysis results showed that the FF‐SSA‐SVM model, which integrates 18 spectral feature bands from near‐infrared transmission spectroscopy and 13 time‐domain and frequency‐domain features, achieved the best performance in discriminating mild moldy‐core. Specifically, the accuracy and F1_score reached 97.97% and 97.45% respectively. It demonstrates that the proposed method of fused near‐infrared transmission spectroscopy and acoustic vibration features can significantly improve the accuracy of detecting mild moldy‐core in apples. Additionally, the AUC of the test set reached 0.9757, indicating that the model has good generalization and robustness for imbalanced datasets. Therefore, this study provides an effective nondestructive testing method for mild moldy‐core of apples and can give some research ideas for internal quality detection of other fruits and vegetables.


Practical Application
This study provides an approach for the precise detection of mild moldy‐core in apples during industrial production.

         <title>Inulin‐Driven Preservation in Frozen Chicken Nuggets: Harnessing Multi‐Method Freezing and Storage</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
Frozen ready‐to‐cook foods, such as chicken nuggets, must maintain their quality throughout storage, from production to retail and final consumption. This study investigates the synergistic effects of inulin incorporation and different freezing methods on the physicochemical properties of chicken nuggets during six months of frozen storage. The nuggets were formulated with and without high‐purity inulin extracted from Jerusalem artichoke and subjected to three distinct freezing methods: static freezing (SF), air‐blast freezing (ABF), and individual quick freezing (IQF). Key quality attributes, including thaw loss, ion leakage, pH, texture, cooking loss, color, and lipid oxidation thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were assessed throughout the storage period. Inulin addition significantly reduced the thaw loss and cooking loss, enhancing the water‐holding capacity. While lipid oxidation increased during storage, TBARS formation was diminished with inulin. Among the freezing methods, IQF helped stabilize the pH fluctuations. The inulin‐added sample frozen using IQF had stable chewiness values during frozen storage. The use of inulin, along with IQF, effectively minimized ion leakage and cooking loss for the storage period. The results suggest that inulin is a promising natural cryoprotectant for enhancing the stability of frozen chicken nuggets. These findings highlight the potential of combining inulin with advanced freezing techniques to develop higher‐quality, stable frozen meat products.


Practical Application
Inulin enhanced the functional quality of chicken nuggets by reducing cooking loss and protecting structural integrity during frozen storage. Additionally, its use as a plant‐based ingredient supports clean‐label formulation while offering cryoprotective benefits, making it a valuable multifunctional additive in frozen emulsion‐type meat products.

         <title>Sustainable Valorization of Olive Oil By‐Products: Green Extraction of Phytochemicals, Encapsulation Strategies, and Food Applications</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Olive oil (OO) production generates significant amounts of by‐products, including olive leaves and pruning residues, olive pomace, OO wastewater, and olive stones. These by‐products are rich in bioactive compounds, particularly polyphenols and secoiridoids, which possess antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, antimicrobial, and cardioprotective properties. However, their stability and bioavailability remain challenges, necessitating innovative recovery and stabilization techniques, highlighting their potential in high‐value industries such as food, cosmetics, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceuticals. This review explores the sustainable valorization of olive by‐products through green extraction methods such as ultrasound‐assisted extraction, microwave‐assisted extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, and so on, and alternative innovative solvents like deep eutectic solvents (DES). These eco‐friendly approaches enhance the recovery of bioactive compounds while minimizing the environmental impact of OO production and the reuse of its by‐products. Additionally, this work explores encapsulation techniques for their effectiveness in protecting and stabilizing phenolic compounds, enhancing their solubility, bioavailability, and controlled release across various applications, including food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and nutraceuticals. Recent studies highlight the effectiveness of chitosan, maltodextrin, cyclodextrin, and alginate as encapsulating agents for OO bioactive compounds, enhancing their stability. Likewise, the review emphasizes the environmental challenges arising from OO residues and discusses the potential role of olive by‐products in circular economy strategies, underlining their potential in sustainable alternatives as biodegradable packaging materials to conventional paper derived from forest‐based feedstocks, synthetic additives, animal feed, functional foods, dietary supplements, agricultural eco‐solutions, and other applications. Moreover, it critically discusses future directions and possible challenges. The findings support the pivotal role of integrated biorefinery approaches in transforming OO by‐products from agro‐industrial waste into high‐value resources, enhancing their efficient industrial applications, promoting sustainability and driving a force in future bioeconomies.

         <title>Effect of dielectric barrier discharge cold plasma on the thin sheet of bean curd during storage: Improve the physical properties, flavor composition, and microbial safety</title>

Abstract
Recent advances in soy product processing have driven the exploration of innovative methods to enhance the preservation quality of soy products. This study introduces dielectric barrier discharge cold plasma (CP) as a non‐thermal processing technique to suppress the proliferation of microorganisms during the storage of thin sheet bean curd (TSBC) and to mitigate the beany odor associated with it. Flavor analysis revealed that the beany odor in TSBC treated with cold plasma decreased by 55.51%, while the non‐beany aroma increased by 39.87% (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the pH and a* color values of TSBC following CP treatment decreased from 6.01 and 1.23 to 5.88 and 0.70 (P &lt; 0.05), respectively. TSBC treated with cold plasma exhibited lower adhesiveness and improved sensory storage capabilities. Additionally, the initial total bacterial count in TSBC was reduced from 4.59 to 3.86 lg CFU∙g−1 (P &lt; 0.05). The logistic bacterial growth model indicated that CP treatment significantly decreased the maximum specific growth rate, effectively inhibiting bacterial growth during storage. This study paves the way for the potential application of cold plasma methods in soy product processing, presenting opportunities to develop more appealing and commercially viable soy products.

         <title>Selection and Characterization of Non‐Saccharomyces Yeast Strains for Potential Use in Arabica and Conilon Coffee Fermentations</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Customized fermentation approaches are necessary due to the differences in the characteristics of Coffea arabica (Arabica) and Coffea canephora (Conilon) coffees. Therefore, this work aimed to select and characterize new non‐Saccharomyces yeast strains with potential use as starter cultures for Arabica and Conilon coffee fermentation, using a coffee peel and pulp medium (CPM). Fifty‐six yeast strains were assessed for pectinolytic activity, and 34 were selected for further evaluation in CPM. Their performance was assessed based on population growth, °Brix, pH, and production of organic acids. Seventeen strains showed significant growth in Arabica CPM and eight in Conilon CPM, ranging from 10.96% to 18.38%. Nine yeast strains showed higher organic acid production in Arabica and five in Conilon, ranging from 0.826 to 1.336 g/L. Volatile compound production was also evaluated, with 44 compounds detected in Arabica and 61 in Conilon fermentations, showing strain‐dependent profiles. Meyerozyma guilliermondii CCMA1737, Meyerozyma caribbica (CCMA1993, CCMA1617, CCMA1992, CCMA1950, and CCMA1735), Pichia kluyveri CCMA1658, Cystofilobasidium ferigula CCMA1647, and Hanseniaspora uvarum CCMA1944 were considered the most promising candidates for fermentations with Arabica coffee. Hanseniaspora uvarum (CCMA1895 and CCMA1944), Rhodotorula mucilaginosa CCMA1663, P. kluyveri CCMA1652, and M. caribbica CCMA1950 were considered the most promising candidates for Conilon fermentation. For the first time, H. uvarum and R. mucilaginosa were selected as potential starter cultures for Conilon coffee fermentation. Future studies should evaluate the suitability of these selected yeasts as starter cultures in coffee fermentation.

&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customized fermentation approaches are necessary due to the differences in the characteristics of &lt;i&gt;Coffea arabica&lt;/i&gt; (Arabica) and &lt;i&gt;Coffea canephora&lt;/i&gt; (Conilon) coffees. Therefore, this work aimed to select and characterize new non-&lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces&lt;/i&gt; yeast strains with potential use as starter cultures for Arabica and Conilon coffee fermentation, using a coffee peel and pulp medium (CPM). Fifty-six yeast strains were assessed for pectinolytic activity, and 34 were selected for further evaluation in CPM. Their performance was assessed based on population growth, °Brix, pH, and production of organic acids. Seventeen strains showed significant growth in Arabica CPM and eight in Conilon CPM, ranging from 10.96% to 18.38%. Nine yeast strains showed higher organic acid production in Arabica and five in Conilon, ranging from 0.826 to 1.336 g/L. Volatile compound production was also evaluated, with 44 compounds detected in Arabica and 61 in Conilon fermentations, showing strain-dependent profiles. &lt;i&gt;Meyerozyma guilliermondii&lt;/i&gt; CCMA1737, &lt;i&gt;Meyerozyma caribbica&lt;/i&gt; (CCMA1993, CCMA1617, CCMA1992, CCMA1950, and CCMA1735), &lt;i&gt;Pichia kluyveri&lt;/i&gt; CCMA1658, &lt;i&gt;Cystofilobasidium ferigula&lt;/i&gt; CCMA1647, and &lt;i&gt;Hanseniaspora uvarum&lt;/i&gt; CCMA1944 were considered the most promising candidates for fermentations with Arabica coffee. &lt;i&gt;Hanseniaspora uvarum&lt;/i&gt; (CCMA1895 and CCMA1944), &lt;i&gt;Rhodotorula mucilaginosa&lt;/i&gt; CCMA1663, &lt;i&gt;P. kluyveri&lt;/i&gt; CCMA1652, and &lt;i&gt;M. caribbica&lt;/i&gt; CCMA1950 were considered the most promising candidates for Conilon fermentation. For the first time&lt;i&gt;, H. uvarum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;R. mucilaginosa&lt;/i&gt; were selected as potential starter cultures for Conilon coffee fermentation.

         <title>Optimization of Subcritical Water Extraction Process for Total Phenolics From Guava and Investigation of Its Antioxidant Activity and Inhibitory Effect on HepG2 Cell Proliferation</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
This investigation utilized subcritical water extraction (SWE) technology to isolate polyphenolic components from Psidium guajava fruits. Process optimization was achieved using response surface methodology (RSM), yielding optimal parameters: a 2.07‐h extraction duration, operating temperature of 203°C, and a solvent‐to‐material ratio of 41:1 mL/g. These conditions resulted in a maximum total phenol content of 72.17 mg/g, surpassing conventional methods. High‐performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC‐MS/MS) was employed to identify 11 distinct polyphenolic constituents. The antioxidant activity of the extracts was assessed using DPPH•(2,2‐Diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl radical), ABTS•+(2,2′‐Azinobis‐(3‐ethylbenzthiazoline‐6‐sulphonat), and PTIO•(2‐Phenyl‐4,4,5,5‐tetramethylimidazoline‐1‐oxyl‐3‐oxide), with IC50 values of 0.168, 0.065, and 2.21 mg/mL, respectively. Additionally, the ferric ion–reducing power was assessed, with absorbance values ranging from 0.191 to 0.339. The extract demonstrated potential hypoglycemic effects, showing α‐glucosidase inhibition at 85.64% (IC50 = 1.16 mg/mL) and α‐amylase inhibition at 73.12% (IC50 = 18.99 mg/mL). Additionally, it inhibited tyrosinase by up to 70.32% (IC50 = 1.28 mg/mL), suggesting potential skin‐whitening properties. Cytotoxicity studies on HepG2 cells revealed significant inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation. The bioactive compounds triggered programmed cell death and disrupted the cell cycle, particularly at S and G2/M checkpoints, indicating strong anti‐proliferative activity against HepG2 cells. These findings suggest that subcritical water extraction technology can significantly enhance the total phenol content of Guava extracts, offering great potential in natural product extraction. Furthermore, the extract demonstrates substantial biological activity, highlighting its application potential in functional food and medicine.


Practical Application
The extraction of phenolic compounds from Psidium guajava using subcritical water was optimized through factorial design and RSM. This approach demonstrated the practicality of bioactive component extraction in an industrial setting. The biological activity of the subcritical water total phenol extract was thoroughly evaluated. Based on these findings, the extract shows potential for applications as a natural preservative, functional food ingredient, or medicinal component, suggesting its possible versatility in health‐related industries.

         <title>Strategy for Sodium‐Salt Substitution in Meat Gel Products: Rheological and Gel Properties of Myosin as Affected by Ion Types and Concentrations</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
In order to reduce sodium chloride intake and related health risks, the effect of NaCl and KCl solutions on the myosin processing properties was investigated at different concentration (0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, and 2.0 m) to explore salt substitution strategy. Myosin solubility increased while turbidity reduced with increasing NaCl and KCl solution concentrations (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with KCl, myosin exhibited greater solubility and lower turbidity in NaCl solutions of the same concentration. The gel hardness and water‐holding capacity peaked at 1.2 m of NaCl or KCl (P &lt; 0.05). As the concentration of NaCl and KCl increases, the microstructure of myosin gels changes from loose to compact and then to rough with the denser structure appears at 1.2 m for NaCl and 1.6 m for KCl. The α‐helix and β‐turn changed differently with the concentration and ionic species while β‐sheet and random‐coil did not alter with the concentration or ionic species (P &gt; 0.05). The α‐helix presented an overall downward trend as concentration of NaCl solutions increased while showed an opposite trend for KCl solutions. Myosin in 1.6 m NaCl or KCl solution could form a gel with fine porous structures and greater hardness and water‐holding capacity, presenting an overall better gel characteristic than the other studied concentrations with no significant difference between the two ions. This study provides a basis for salt reduction in meat gel products.

         <title>Efficacy of probiotic supplementation in influencing cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta‐analysis</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and behavioral changes. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota influences central nervous system function. Probiotic interventions may offer a promising therapeutic approach by modulating the gut microbiota composition and potentially improving cognitive outcomes in AD patients. This meta‐analysis aimed to assess the effects of probiotic supplementation on cognitive function in AD patients by analyzing randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024508725), we conducted a comprehensive search across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov through April 9th, 2024. Only double‐blind RCTs comparing probiotic supplementation to placebo in patients aged 65 or older with clinically diagnosed AD were included. Primary outcomes were cognitive function scores from validated tools like MMSE and TYM. Our stringent inclusion criteria identified four double‐blind RCTs with 251 participants aged 65 or older with clinically diagnosed AD. Statistical analysis using a random‐effects model revealed significant cognitive improvement in probiotic‐treated groups compared to placebo controls (Standardized Mean Difference [SMD] = 0.67; 95% CI [0.14, 1.19]; P &lt; 0.05), though substantial heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 79.16%). Subgroup analyses indicated that probiotic formulation type, dosage, and baseline AD severity may influence cognitive outcomes. While these findings suggest probiotics may offer cognitive benefits for AD patients, the high heterogeneity and limited study number necessitate additional well‐designed clinical trials to confirm these promising results and establish optimal treatment protocols for clinical implementation.

         <title>Optimization of the Production of Press Cake Paste From Apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) Kernels and Prediction of Shelf‐Life Kinetics of the Product</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
The study comprises the production, optimization, and shelf‐life assessment of a paste made from apricot kernel press cake, which is a by‐product obtained during the extraction of apricot kernel oil. The product formulation was optimized using the response surface method, and physicochemical, microbiological, textural, sensory, and accelerated shelf‐life tests were performed during storage at different temperatures (22°C, 35°C, and 45°C). As a result of the optimization, the software designed two different paste formulations, including A: shelled press cake paste containing 1.17 ratio of sorbet/press cake, B: shelled press cake paste containing 0.95 ratio of sorbet/press cake and control, and C: unshelled press cake paste containing 1.06 ratio of sorbet/press cake. While the protein content in the shelled paste was 30.79±0.37%, it was determined to be 27.10±0.13% in the unshelled paste. Moisture, water activity (aw), and pH decreased with increasing temperature and storage time, while the content of free fatty acids and peroxides increased. No yeasts and molds or coliform bacteria were detected in the samples. The sample with 1.17 L/kg sorbet/pressed cake received the highest score in the sensory and textural analyses. The estimation of the shelf life based on the peroxide value showed that the shelf life of pastes A, B, and C was 123.2, 125.17, and 97.92 days, respectively. These results show that the high‐protein paste made from apricot kernel press cake is well accepted by consumers as an alternative product, and they also show that waste can be used to create economic added value.

Moisture, water activity (aw), and pH decreased with increasing temperature and storage time, while the content of free fatty acids and peroxides increased. No yeasts and molds or coliform bacteria were detected in the samples. The sample with 1.17 L/kg sorbet/pressed cake received the highest score in the sensory and textural analyses. The estimation of the shelf life based on the peroxide value showed that the shelf life of pastes A, B, and C was 123.2, 125.17, and 97.92 days, respectively. These results show that the high-protein paste made from apricot kernel press cake is well accepted by consumers as an alternative product, and they also show that waste can be used to create economic added value.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effects of Ginger (Zingiber Officinale Roscoe) Essential Oil and Zein Pickering Nanoemulsion on the Shelf Life of Pufferfish (Takifugu Obscurus) During Cold Storage</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
Seafood is susceptible to spoilage due to lipid oxidation, endogenous enzymes, and microbial growth. Pickering nanoemulsions (PN) containing active substances have emerged as a promising approach to enhancing preservation and extending shelf life. In this study, ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) essential oil (GEO) and zein (Z) were homogenized by multi‐frequency ultrasound to prepare a PN. The effects of PN with different concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4%, v/v) of GEO on the preservation and bacteriostasis of puffer fish fillets were studied. The outcomes demonstrated that the TVC of the 0.4% GEO group samples was only 6.55 log CFU/g on the 18th day during cold storage, indicating that the GEO‐Z‐PN could effectively inhibit microbial growth. Thus, the pufferfish could maintain a low pH and slow down the changes in TVB‐N and TBA. On the 18th day, the pH value was 6.25, the TBA value was 0.39 mg MDA/kg, and the TVB‐N decreased from 42.32 to 21.01 mg N/100 g. Texture analysis also revealed that the 0.4% GEO group samples exhibited better muscle quality, characterized by higher hardness and chewiness. The results of water migration and tertiary structure showed that a 0.4% GEO treatment effectively alleviated the damage to the interprotein covalent cross‐linking structure and the intermuscular fiber interaction force. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) results showed that myofibrillar protein (MP) aggregation and inhomogeneity decreased in the 0.4% GEO group samples during cold storage. The shelf life of puffer fish might be increased from 9 days to 18 days with 0.4% GEO.


Practical Application
This research holds practical value in the food industry. Through the utilization of the prepared PN containing ginger essential oil, the preservation of puffer fish fillets can be significantly enhanced. It is capable of prolonging the shelf life from nine days to 18 days, enabling consumers to enjoy fresher puffer fish products.

         <title>A Clinical Prediction Model Integrated With Machine Learning Algorithms Uncovers the Associations Between Dietary Omega‐3, Its Components, and Aging Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
This study aimed to explore the associations between dietary omega‐3 intake (including alpha‐linolenic acid [ALA], eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and aging biomarkers (specifically DNA methylation age [HorvathAge], telomere length [Horvathtelo], and phenotypic age) in older adults by constructing clinical prediction models through cross‐sectional, machine learning (ML), and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Linear regression models, supplemented by restricted cubic splines (RCS) for nonlinearity detection, were established using dietary omega‐3 intake (excluding supplements) from participants in the 1999–2002 NHANES. Causal associations were further validated via MR analysis using the inverse‐variance weighted. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis of ML‐enhanced model interpretability. High intake (&gt; 1.631 g/day) was inversely associated with HorvathAge and phenotypic age but positively correlated with Horvathtelo. High ALA intake (≥ 1.520 g/day) exhibited similar effects, which were validated by MR causality analyses. Furthermore, high omega‐3 and ALA levels were inversely associated with phenotypic age. Notably, elevated EPA and DHA levels were exclusively positively associated with Horvathtelo. The RCS models revealed nonlinear associations between omega‐3 (and its components) and Horvathtelo, as well as between EPA/DHA and HorvathAge. The SHAP analysis of linear support vector machine (LSVM) ranked feature importance as omega‐3 &gt; ALA &gt; DHA &gt; EPA. Increasing omega‐3 and ALA intake was significantly associated with reduced HorvathAge, while components (ALA/EPA/DHA) improved Horvathtelo through nonlinear dose‐response effects. MR validated anti‐aging associations for omega‐3 and ALA. The LSVM model prioritized omega‐3 as the most influential feature, followed by ALA, DHA, and EPA.

         <title>Lipid Regulation of Tea Protein Lipid‐Lowering Peptides on 3T3‐L1 Preadipocytes and High‐Fat Mice</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
In this study, tea protein lipid‐lowering peptides were prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis, and 3T3‐L1 preadipocytes and high‐fat mice were used to investigate its in vitro and in vivo lipid regulating effect. The results showed that tea protein lipid‐lowering peptides could significantly inhibit the adipogenic differentiation of 3T3‐L1 preadipocytes and reduce lipid accumulation. At the peptides concentration of 0.1 mg/mL, the content of total triglyceride, total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein, and high‐density lipoprotein of the cells decreased or increased by 38.57%, 47.71%, 46.68%, and 49.29%, respectively. Feeding lipid‐lowering peptides could significantly inhibit the weight gain of high‐fat mice, reduce fat accumulation and organ burden, and inhibit the degeneration of liver and epididymal fat. High concentration of lipid‐lowering peptides (200 mg/kg) significantly reduced the atherosclerosis index and coronary artery risk index by 58.52% and 42.90%, respectively. Intestinal flora analysis showed that lipid‐lowering peptides could increase the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, and increase the relative abundance of Muribaculaceae, while decreasing the overall abundance of Bacteroidetes. These changes help to restore the homeostasis of intestinal flora and thus have a positive regulatory effect on obesity and related metabolic disorders.

         <title>Fast and Accurate Classification of Corn Varieties Using Deep Learning With Edge Detection Techniques</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Correct grading of corn for food production raises the standard of products offered to consumers and maintains product quality. Classification ensures optimal storage and processing conditions. As a result, losses are minimized, costs are reduced, and agriculture becomes more sustainable. When dealing with huge data, classification needs to be done quickly and accurately. A faster way of achieving the same classification success was explored in this study. Deep learning models ResCNN, DAG‐Net, and ResNet‐18 were used to classify three corn varieties named Chulpi Cancha, Indurata, and Rugosa. With 1050 corn images, the classification process was carried out. A total of three datasets were obtained using Canny edge detection algorithm (CEDA), Sobel edge detection algorithm (SEDA), and normal color images (CI). Based on experimental studies with CI, the accuracy values of 0.9952, 1, 0.9952; 0.9933, 1, 0.9933; and 0.9952, 1, 0.9952 were obtained for Chulpi Cancha, Indurata, Rugosa corn varieties using ResCNN, DAG‐Net, and ResNet‐18 deep learning models, respectively. With the images generated by CEDA, the accuracy values for Chulpi Cancha, Indurata, and Rugosa corn varieties were 0.9904, 1, 0.9904; 0.9952, 0.9990, 0.9961; and 0.9952, 1, 0.9952, respectively. Using ResCNN, DAG‐Net, and ResNet‐18 deep learning models, accuracy values were obtained. Based on the images obtained through SEDA, the accuracy values for Chulpi Cancha, Indurata, and Rugosa corn varieties were 0.9933, 1, 0.9933; 0.9952, 1, 0.9952; and 0.9952, 1, 0.9952 using ResCNN, DAG‐Net, and ResNet‐18 deep learning models, respectively. ResCNN, DAG‐Net, and ResNet‐18 models trained faster than CI.

ABSTRACT
Microorganisms play a critical role in determining the quality of fermented chili paste. However, spoilage microorganisms residing on the surface of chili peppers can compromise sensory attributes and reduce edibility. This study aims to adopt chlorine dioxide to reduce spoilage microorganisms prior to fermentation, and the effects on chili paste quality were systematically evaluated. The pretreatment (soaking in 75 mg/L chlorine dioxide solution for 10 min) significantly reduced microbial richness and abundance on chili surfaces. Physicochemical analysis indicated that this reduction facilitated fermentation, as evidenced by increased total acid and decreased levels of nitrite, capsaicin, and reducing sugars. Inoculation with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) further enhanced flavor development by promoting the accumulation of lactic acid, malic acid, and acetic acid, while suppressing the formation of bitter amino acids. These changes contributed to a sweet, floral, and fruity aroma profile. In total, 64 volatile compounds were identified, including 23 characteristic aroma components such as ethanol, citronellol, acetoin, phenylethyl alcohol, and ethyl acetate. Fermentation following sterilization and LAB inoculation resulted in a higher content and more layered composition of volatile flavor components. Overall, bacteria‐reducing pretreatment markedly improves the quality and flavor complexity of fermented chili paste. The problems such as the long fermentation period and insufficient flavor of chili paste under the conditions of unsterilized pretreatment and natural fermentation have been solved.
Practical Applications: Few reports address the combination of chlorine dioxide pretreatment with targeted LAB inoculation in chili paste preparation. Bacteria‐reducing pretreatment greatly improved the safety quality of fermented chili paste. Bacteria‐reducing pretreatment enriched the flavor of chili paste, and provided fruity, floral and sweet aroma.

         <title>Physicochemical Properties of Runner Bean and Their Starch, With a Comparison to Corn Starch</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
The growing demand for sustainable and plant‐based ingredients in the food and non‐food industries has driven interest in alternative starch and protein sources. Runner beans, a lesser known legume, offer a promising but underexplored source of starch with unique functional properties. This study aims to evaluate the physical, physicochemical, and functional properties of starch from two distinct varieties of runner beans (Scarlet Emperor and White Swan), which exhibit notable phenotypic differences in appearance. Corn starch was included as a reference sample for starch isolates. Scarlet Emperor starch exhibited significant differences in amylose, amylopectin, relative crystallinity, pasting, and flow properties but similar crystallinity (C‐type), oil absorption capacity compared to White Swan starch. Both starches also differed significantly from the corn starch control in terms of functional, pasting, and rheological properties. Extracted starches were pure with high starch content (∼96%), high lightness value (∼94) but different amylose content, 28.38 for White Swan and 30.89% for Scarlet Emperor compared to corn starch (29.67%). Both runner bean starches were smooth, bigger, and displayed higher viscosity and firmer gels than the corn starch control. These findings suggest that runner bean starch can complement with corn starch, providing better thickening capacity in food systems.

         <title>Organic Acids Copigmentation With Hibiscus syriacus Flower (Hibiscus syriacus L.) Anthocyanins: Thermal Stability, Characterization, and Copigmentation Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
Hibiscus syriacus flowers are not only aesthetically pleasing but also palatable. However, their vibrant colors tend to fade easily due to the high concentration of anthocyanins. In this work, three organic acids (malic, tartaric, and citric) were employed to copigment H. syriacus flowers. This investigation systematically examined the effects of these acids on the chromatic properties and thermostability of anthocyanins, with particular emphasis on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying copigmentation phenomena. Nontargeted metabolomic analysis revealed the presence of 34 distinct anthocyanins in desiccated H. syriacus flowers. Notably, treatment with organic acids significantly enhanced both the compositional diversity and abundance of anthocyanins relative to untreated controls. All three organic acids demonstrated chromatic effects, enhancing the thermal stability of the anthocyanin extracts and preventing browning at pH 2.2. After being heated at 90°C for 4 h, the retention rates of anthocyanins in the malic, tartaric, and citric acid treatment groups increased by 13.67%, 23.05%, and 13.32%, respectively, compared with the control group. Among the three acids, tartaric acid exhibited the most pronounced stabilization effect. Thermal degradation kinetics of H. syriacus anthocyanins followed first‐order reaction models (R2 &gt; 0.9). Furthermore, combined spectroscopic and computational analyses—including Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations—demonstrated that organic acids form stable complexes with anthocyanins via intermolecular hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. Thus, the H. syriacus flowers treated with organic acids exhibited enhanced color and thermal stability compared to untreated anthocyanins, making them suitable for further development into jam products.

         <title>Physicochemical, Phenolic, and Antioxidant Profiles of Vitis vinifera L. and Vitis labrusca L. Grapes From Artvin, Eastern Black Sea Region</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Grapes (Vitis spp.) are the most extensively cultivated fruit globally, with their composition influenced by genotype and geographical factors. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the physicochemical characteristics, bioactive compound profiles, and antioxidant capacities of Vitis vinifera L. and Vitis labrusca L. grapes cultivated in the Artvin region of Türkiye, in order to highlight their nutritional and functional potential and to contribute to the scientific understanding of regional grape biodiversity, which remains underexplored. The samples were analyzed for size, color, total soluble solids, and sugar composition. Fructose and glucose were identified as the predominant sugars, with total sugar content ranging from 3.40% to 9.80%. Antioxidant activity was assessed using ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and DPPH radical scavenging assays. Phenolic composition was determined via HPLC‐PDA using 26 phenolic standards, including resveratrol. The total phenolic content (TPC) varied between 28.67 and 113.54 mg GAE/100 g FW. Catechin, epicatechin, rutin, chrysin, pinocembrin, gallic acid, and resveratrol are common phenolic compounds found in grapes. It was determined that the sugar and phenolic compound profiles of grape varieties in the Artvin region are similar; however, their concentrations exhibit variations.

         <title>Flavor Substances of Plant Foods: A Review of Structural Properties, Biogenic Flavor Mechanisms, and Challenges</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
The demand for plant foods (PFs) is increasing worldwide, partly because of considerations of sustainable development and environmental protection, and partly because PFs are an important part of the healthy dietary structure of the population and an important source of nutrients. Flavor substances of PFs give the food unique sensory properties and are an important factor influencing consumer preferences. This review focused on the flavor substances of PFs and systematically described their structural properties, including the key functional groups in the molecular structure. The biogenic flavor mechanisms were revealed in depth in terms of the roles of taste and olfactory receptors. Finally, current challenges were analyzed. This review addresses the lack of systematic exploration and in‐depth evaluation of flavor substances of foods in the current food field, especially in plant‐based foods, reveals the biogenic flavor mechanisms, and provides a comprehensive theoretical reference for in‐depth research and development in the field of flavors of PFs.

         <title>The Leavening Agents Affect the Protein–Starch Matrix Formation and In Vitro Starch Digestibility of Chinese Steamed Bread</title>

Abstract
The present study investigates the influence of different fermentation starters—sourdough and commercial yeast—on the textural characteristics, structural features, and in vitro starch digestibility of Chinese steamed bread (CSB). Two commercial yeast strains (CD0672 and CD0731) and sourdoughs from distinct regions in China (SDJZ‐Shandong Jiaozi and SXJZ‐Shaanxi Jiaozi) were utilized. The sourdough fermented SXJZ‐CSB exhibited the highest hardness (15.94 N/cm2), chewiness (1558.39), and total phenolic content (0.63 mg GAE/g). Compared to yeast‐CSB, sourdough fermentation altered the secondary structure of protein, resulting in a significantly higher proportion of β‐turns in sourdough‐CSB. Principal component analysis (PCA) further confirmed that fermentation type significantly affects protein structure, with sourdough‐CSBs clustering separately from yeast‐CSBs. Moreover, in vitro digestion assays using both intestinal (ID) and gastrointestinal (GID) models revealed significantly lower starch digestion in sourdough‐CSBs, likely due to a denser protein‐starch matrix that hindered enzymatic breakdown. These findings suggest that sourdough fermentation influences the structural properties of CSB, contributing to reduced starch digestibility and potentially lowering glycemic responses.

Principal component analysis (PCA) further confirmed that fermentation type significantly affects protein structure, with sourdough-CSBs clustering separately from yeast-CSBs. Moreover, in vitro digestion assays using both intestinal (ID) and gastrointestinal (GID) models revealed significantly lower starch digestion in sourdough-CSBs, likely due to a denser protein-starch matrix that hindered enzymatic breakdown. These findings suggest that sourdough fermentation influences the structural properties of CSB, contributing to reduced starch digestibility and potentially lowering glycemic responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Seaweed Proteins: Properties, Extraction, Challenges, and Prospects</title>

ABSTRACT
The growing global population and increasing demand for sustainable protein sources have intensified interest in seaweed as a viable plant‐based alternative. Seaweed‐derived proteins and peptides are rich in essential amino acids and exhibit promising functional and bioactive properties, making them attractive for food applications. However, several challenges hinder their widespread use, including difficulties in protein extraction and purification, the presence of potentially harmful compounds, and limited digestibility of the extracted proteins. This review critically examines the nutritional, functional, and bioactive properties of proteins and peptides derived from seaweed, while also addressing key obstacles related to extraction and application. Specific focus is placed on issues such as the rigidity of the seaweed cell wall, low protein solubility, digestibility, and the presence of antinutritional factors, toxic compounds, and allergens. Given that protein quantification remains a significant challenge in this field, current quantification methods and their limitations are also reviewed. Furthermore, this study provides a critical evaluation of the extraction methods employed for isolating proteins and peptides from seaweed. This review also emphasizes the importance of adopting a biorefinery perspective for seaweed protein extraction to ensure the efficient and sustainable utilization of the entire seaweed biomass. Moreover, this review examines the ongoing commercial development of seaweed protein and its potential for market integration. In conclusion, future perspectives are discussed, including the potential of bottom‐up approaches, the integration of seaweed‐derived proteins and peptides into food systems, and the importance of understanding their interactions with other biomolecules, which may influence their functional and nutritional properties.

         <title>Chemical Profiling via LC‐ESI‐MS/MS and Functional Bioactivities of Foeniculum vulgare subsp. Capillaceum: Insights Into Antioxidant, Antidiabetic, and Antibacterial Potentials for Food Applications</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
Driven by the increasing interest in the incorporation of naturally derived ingredients in functional foods, researchers have placed greater emphasis on the process of identifying bioactive constituents from medicinal plants, as they can provide health benefits and nutritional potential. This study offers a phytochemical profiling and bioactivities investigation conducted for the first time for an Algerian wild Foeniculum vulgare subsp. capillaceum, focusing on its potential for functional food applications. Extracts from the aerial portions of the plant were prepared using a sequence of solvents, starting from n‐hexane, followed by acetone, methanol, and finally deionized water to efficiently separate compounds based on their solubility characteristics. Subsequently, these extracts were subjected to a detection, characterization, and precise quantification of the diverse phenolic constituents present in the samples with LC‐MS/MS. A total of 17 phenolic metabolites were characterized, with rutin and chlorogenic acid emerging as the major constituents. Among the extracts, the methanolic fraction demonstrated the greatest concentration of overall identified phenolic compounds (11.874 mg/g), accompanied by notable antioxidant capacity reflected in its effective neutralization of free radicals, recording IC₅₀ measurements of 28.69 µg/mL for DPPH radical and 24.72 µg/mL for ABTS cations. Interestingly, the hexanic extract demonstrated the strongest α‐amylase inhibition (50.06% at 400 µg/mL), suggesting antidiabetic potential, while the acetonic extract displayed notable antibacterial activity, particularly against Micrococcus luteus (MIC = 1.56 mg/mL). These findings highlight F. vulgare subsp. capillaceum as a rich reservoir of compounds with biological activities positions it as a promising addition to functional foods designed to improve nutritional value and safety.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Extraction, Functional Characteristics, and Food Applications of Plant Oleosomes</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Oleosomes, naturally occurring in plants, mammals, and microorganisms, are highly valued in both food and non‐food industries due to their unique composition, inherent emulsifying properties, and straightforward extraction processes. Despite advancements in twin‐screw pressing and ultrasound‐assisted methods, this review emphasizes the need to systematically explore aqueous‐based method—including aqueous, aqueous enzymatic, salt‐solution extraction, and alkali‐solution extraction method—that have been underrepresented. For the first time, it highlights how factors such as polyphenols, polysaccharides, pH, temperature, and ionic conditions influence oleosome stability and digestion, which are critical for lipid release, absorption, and nutritional improvement—key aspects aligned with the development of functional foods. This review examines oleosome composition, extraction methods, and factors influencing their stability and digestibility, highlighting their broad application potential.

         <title>The Impact of Fermenter Shape on the Performance of White Wine Alcoholic Fermentation and the Composition of the Resulting Wines in Laboratory‐Scale Trials</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
A great variety of vessels, including tanks with different shapes and made with different materials, have been installed in wineries during the last decade. However, the influence of the vessel shape itself during alcoholic fermentation and finished wine composition has not been assessed. In the present study, four different shaped borosilicate flasks (cylindrical, conical, ovoid, and spherical) were used to perform alcoholic fermentation of white grape juice in triplicate, following two different inoculation procedures: monoinoculation with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae commercial strain and sequential inoculation with Metschnikowia pulcherrima and Saccharomyces cerevisiae commercial strains. The shape of the fermenter impacted alcoholic fermentation performance and the composition of the resulting wines, although the influence of fermenter shape depended on the inoculation protocol. For example, flasks with hemispheric bottoms differed from those with flat bottoms in fermentation rate, yeast population, and dissolved oxygen throughout monoinoculated fermentation. In contrast, for the sequentially inoculated fermentations, the wines from the cylindrical flasks had the lowest contents of soluble polysaccharides (around 28% less) and volatile compounds (around 43% less). These results highlight the importance of the shape of fermenters, which should be considered a non‐negligible factor in laboratory‐scale trials as well as for winemaking at an industrial level.


Practical Application
The present study can help winemakers to better understand the influence of employing vats and vessels with different shapes (such as the fashionable egg‐shaped tanks) during alcoholic fermentation to produce white wines. Moreover, the presented results point to the relevance of the shape of fermentation flasks at laboratory scale to perform fermentative trials, given that the shape of the fermenter flask impacted the volatile composition and polysaccharides profile of the resulting wines.

         <title>Comparison of High‐Pressure and Normal‐Pressure Stewing on Physicochemical and Structural Properties of Pork Bone Soup and Micro–Nanoparticles (MNPs) Inside</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Pork bone soup, as one of the most popular worldwide diets, is famous for its desirable taste and nutritional benefits. The physicochemical properties and structural characteristics determine the quality of soup. Herein, this study investigated the impact of normal‐pressure (100 kPa) and high‐pressure (170 kPa) stewing on the physicochemical and structural properties of pork bone soup and its micro–nanoparticles (MNPs) inside. Normal‐pressure stewing enhanced the release of proteins and triglycerides, resulting in a stable, uniform emulsion with MNPs displaying particle sizes around 260 nm, a narrow polydispersity index (PDI) (∼0.25), and good dispersion. In contrast, high‐pressure stewing accelerated protein solubilization and induced extensive protein unfolding and aggregation, as evidenced by increased fluorescence intensity, elevated surface hydrophobicity, and significant shifts in Fourier transform infrared (FT‐IR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectra. Although high‐pressure stewing improved nutrient extraction, with protein concentrations reaching 3.46 versus 1.9 mg/mL under normal‐pressure stewing, it produced less stable MNPs. Importantly, over 60% of total proteins and triglycerides were retained in MNPs under both conditions, highlighting their key role in soup stability and nutritional quality. These findings offer comparative insights into MNP behavior under different household stewing pressures and provide guidance for enhancing the quality of bone‐based soups.

         <title>Wound Healing Potential of a Formulation Containing Yerba Mate (Ilex paraguariensis) Extract: A Preclinical Study in a Rat Model of Undernutrition</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
The development of novel formulations to promote an accelerated wound healing process is an important need in medicine. Yerba mate (YM) (Ilex paraguariensis A. St. Hil.) exhibits significant biological activities, and we here developed a YM‐based formulation (YMF), combining a natural and polyphenol‐rich YM extract with a mixture of amino acids and vitamins, and assessed its healing effect in undernourished rats in comparison to normonourished rats subjected to excisional wounds. Two full‐thickness wounds were performed when the weight difference between the normal and undernourished groups reached 30%–35%, and then the diet of both the undernourished control undernourished treated groups was changed to a normal nutritional condition. The treatment consisted of supplying rats with YMF (15 mL/100 g body weight/day) in replacement of drinking water from 7 days before surgery until the end of these studies. Wound closure analysis revealed a progressive increase in wound contraction in undernourished rats treated with YMF until an advanced stage of healing as compared to control animals. Histology showed a higher total score with better angiogenesis and inflammation scores in YMF‐treated animals (p &lt; 0.01). Some hematological and biochemical variables were significantly correlated with the nutrition and YMF treatment. Besides, the body weight of animals did not change during the treatment, with the exception of day 12 after surgery, when this parameter was higher in the undernourished treated group than in the undernourished control group (p &lt; 0.05). Taken together, the new YMF improved the healing of excisional wounds in a preclinical animal model and could be considered a nutraceutical for the treatment of nutritionally affected patients with complex wounds.
Practical Application: This work has revealed the potential of the new yerba mate–based formulation (YMF) for improving the healing wound in an animal model of undernutrition subjected to surgery. Although we used a single YMF dose selected from preclinical–clinical safety and efficacy studies in diverse therapeutic scenarios, YMF can be considered a nutraceutical for the treatment of nutritionally affected patients undergoing surgery with complex wounds. Further clinical testing to confirm efficacy, optimal dosing, and specific therapeutic window of application is needed.

         <title>Soy Protein Hydrolysate Accentuates the Cocoa‐Like Flavor Attributes of Carob‐Based Dark Chocolate</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
Roasted carob pulp is known for its faint cocoa‐like flavor. Although it exhibits potential as a cocoa replacer, its cocoa‐like aroma and bitter taste are weaker than those of conventional cocoa. To shrink this flavor gap, the present study detailed a novel approach of tapping on crude protein hydrolysates for the accentuation of these flavor attributes in dark chocolates. A comparison between protease types (Flavourzyme and Neutrase) and protein substrates (whey, pea, soy, wheat, and endogenous carob pulp protein) revealed that soy protein hydrolysates derived from Flavourzyme treatment contained the highest branched‐chain amino acids (BCAA; 68.82 mg/g) and short‐chain peptide content (3.04 × 107 peak area). Hydrolysate‐added carob pulp was correlated with a distinct increase in BCAA‐derived 2‐methylbutanal (38.3%) and 3‐methylbutanal (69.8%) and the generation of a diverse group of alkylpyrazines, including 2‐methylpyrazine (0.34 µg/g) and 3‐ethyl‐2,5‐dimethylpyrazine (0.12 µg/g). Descriptive sensory analysis revealed a distinct increase in bitterness, which could be correlated with the introduction of short‐chain bitter peptides.


Practical Application
This study successfully validates an approach for the promotion of cocoa‐like flavor attributes of roasted carob pulp. In light of current cocoa supply constraints and challenges in sustainable production, these findings are envisioned to enhance consumer acceptance of carob applications in cocoa‐based products. This is especially significant for consumers who desire the cocoa‐like flavor impression in such products.

         <title>Study of Influence of Mixed‐Mode Solar Drying on Chlorophyll, Ascorbic Acid, Carotenoid, and Antioxidant Activity of Medicinal Leaves of Ageratina Variety pichinchensis</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
Ageratina pichinchensis leaves are a valuable product with a presence of bioactive compounds that require alternatives for preservation for their perishable nature, so the present research was aimed to evaluate the physicochemical properties and bioactive compound preservation of the Ageratina medicinal leaves variety A. pichinchensis using sustainable drying methods based on renewable energies versus conventional electric dryers. Unifactorial design was adopted studying the type of dryer: open sun, oven, electric controlled conditions dryer, solar dryer with mesh shade (50% and 90%), and indirect solar dryer. Fresh leaves moisture content was 76.45% and water activity 0.995. The colorimetric analysis results were as follows: lightness 34.58, a −10.90, b 22.14, chroma 22.14, and hue angle 119.50°. Chlorophyll content was 0.129 mg/g dry weight, carotenoids 2.045 mg/g dry weight, and ascorbic acid 403.742 mg/100 g dry weight. Indirect solar drying and 90% mesh shade reached the highest chlorophyll content 6.814 and 6.052 mg/g dry weight, respectively. Carotenoids showed an increase with oven drying (18.468 mg/g dry weight), attributed to the short time of drying process. Antioxidant activity of dried leaves was from 90.606% to 94.924%. The lowest color difference (4.56) was obtained in solar drying (90% mesh shade). Indirect and 90% mesh shade solar drying better preserved the leaves properties, demonstrating the effectiveness of the solar drying method to produce high‐quality products for different applications. Although open sun drying is an economical technique, its benefits are partially diminished by various issues such as damage from rodents, birds, and insects; contamination from dust; exposure to rain; and the risks of either over‐drying or under‐drying.


Practical Application
According to the results from this investigation, indirect solar drying and solar drying using mesh shades are sustainable alternatives to preserve herbs that not only supply a characteristic flavor to food products but also have some therapeutic and medicinal effects that can become value‐added ingredients for various supplements, drugs, and medicinal products. We consider that this investigation made a great contribution and impact to the field of medicinal herb preservation and its applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. This could benefit the producers to take advantage of the herbs they cultivate and promote their usage and commercialization with added value due to the health contributions that medicinal herbs could bring to possible consumers in addition to the use of easy, sustainable, and cheap equipment.

         <title>The Key Egg White Proteins Involved in Foam Formation and Foam Stability</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
This study determined the major egg white proteins for foaming and foam stability. The natural and lysozyme‐free egg whites were 2x diluted and blended with a KitchenAid blender for 5 minutes to make foams. The foams were collected, held at room temperature for 2 hr, and drained. Samples were collected 5 minutes after blending and 2 hr after foam collection. The forming and sampling processes were repeated 2 more times after putting the drain back into the residual egg white. The proteins in the samples were separated using SDS‐PAGE, the proportion of each band was calculated, and the proteins in the band were identified using tandem mass spectrometry. Ovotransferrin, ovalbumin, and ovomucoid were the three main proteins for foaming. The proportions of ovomucin, ovomacroglobulin, ovalbumin‐related protein Y, TENP proteins, clusterin and ovalbumin fragments, avidin, and lysozyme were either dramatically increased or newly appeared in the foams after 2 hr of holding, indicating they were the main proteins for foam stability. The contributions of ovalbumin, ovotransferrin, and ovomucoid to foam stability were smaller than their proportions in the egg white. The dried weight of the first foam from natural egg white was twice as high, but that of the ovomucin‐rich fraction was half of the lysozyme‐free egg white due to the formation of ovomucin‐lysozyme complexes in the egg foams. It was concluded that the solubility, formation of complexes, fragmentation, and polymerization of proteins were important for foam stability.

         <title>Value‐Added Products From Baijiu Distillers’ Grains: Bioactive Flavonoids and the Evaluation of Its Potential Function</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Baijiu distillers’ grains (BDGs) are the largest by‐products in the Baijiu brewing industry. As the main raw material for Baijiu brewing, sorghum contains rich bioactive flavonoids. During the brewing of Baijiu, the bioactive flavonoids are primarily retained in BDGs. In this study, flavonoids from BDGs (BDF) were extracted using an ethanol‐assisted ultrasonic method, and their bioactivities and functions were assessed in vitro and in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). The results showed that the extraction rate of BDF reached 4.73 mg/g under optimal extraction conditions (extraction time: 78 min, extraction temperature: 40°C, liquid‐to‐solid ratio: 47:1 mL/g, ethanol percentage: 76%). In vitro, BDF exhibited superior antioxidant and anti‐amyloid fibrosis activities. In C. elegans, BDF effectively delayed aging and enhanced stress resistance. Functions of BDF in vivo could be explained by the fact that BDF significantly reduced the ROS and protein deposition level, and activated antioxidant defense system. Genetic analyses showed BDF activated the stress‐regulated transcriptional factors HSF‐1 and SKN‐1. These findings suggested BDF has application potential in anti‐aging and enhancement of resistance and offered a novel strategy for utilizing BDGs.

         <title>Immunomodulatory Effect of Phosvitin Phosphopeptides on Forced Swimming‐Induced Immune Dysfunction in BALB/c Mice</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
The dysfunction of the immune system can make the host susceptible to various diseases, and the consumption of immunomodulating agents can be an effective way to control immune responses. Phosphopeptides derived from egg yolk phosvitin exert various beneficial effects. This study investigated the immunomodulatory effect of egg yolk‐derived phosvitin phosphopeptides (PPPs) on forced swimming‐induced immune dysfunction in BALB/c mice. PPPs were prepared by high‐temperature and mild‐pressure (HTMP) pretreatment and enzyme hydrolysis combinations. PPPs, HTMP (HTMP pretreatment alone), and HTMP‐TM (HTMP pretreatment‐trypsin + thermolysin hydrolysis) (200 mg/kg body weight/d) were administered orally to mice for 14 days before the final forced swimming of 10.5 min. PPPs resulted in a significant decrease in splenic T‐ and B‐lymphocyte proliferation in mice with immune alterations induced by high‐intensity exercise. The administration of PPPs enhanced the natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity in forced swimming‐induced mice. Also, PPPs exerted potent immunomodulatory effects by regulating the levels of cytokines (interferon IFN‐γ, interleukin IL‐2, IL‐4, IL‐6, and IL‐10), serum immunoglobulins (IgA, IgE, and IgG), and nitric oxide (NO) in the splenocytes of BALB/c mice. These results suggest that PPPs have the potential to be developed as immunomodulatory components in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

         <title>Firmness Loss in Blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) Is Associated With Increased PG Activity, Upregulation of Softening‐Related Genes, and Pectin Metabolism</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
Fruit firmness serves as a critical quality parameter in blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum). However, the interplay between fruit firmness and pectin dynamics during fruit development remains inadequately characterized. This study aims to compare the relationship between pectin composition and firmness variations during the developmental stages of three southern highbush blueberry cultivars: “Legacy”, “Emerald”, and “Jewel”. Throughout fruit development, firmness in all three cultivars declined progressively from stage S3 onward. Notably, “Legacy” and “Emerald” exhibited a transient increase in firmness from stage S3 to S4, achieving peak values of 20.2976 N and 20.6128 N, respectively, followed by a sharp decline from stage S4 to S5. Micromorphology analysis revealed that firm‐fruited blueberries are characterized by cells with high inclusion content and well‐preserved cellular structures, whereas softer fruits displayed pronounced cell wall deformation. Concurrently, the reduction in firmness was associated with an increase in soluble pectin content and elevated pectinase activity, with polygalacturonase (PG, EC3.2.1.15) activity peaking during the S4–S5 and S8 stages. Transcriptomic profiling identified 20 differentially expressed genes linked to pectin metabolism, among which VcPG3 and VcPG6 exhibited a strong correlation with firmness changes, as confirmed by qRT‐PCR validation. Metabolomic analysis further identified N‐acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) as a key metabolite contributing to firmness variation across cultivars. In conclusion, the integrated physio‐biochemical and multi‐omics analyses of these blueberry cultivars not only elucidate the molecular and metabolic basis of firmness differences but also provide a foundation for deciphering the regulatory mechanisms governing pectin‐like substance synthesis in blueberries.

         <title>Fermentation‐Engineered Sea Buckthorn and Monk Fruit Beverage Exhibiting Antioxidative Potential and Cytotoxic Activity Against HepG2 Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
Functional foods have gained significant attention due to their potential health advantages. Sea buckthorn and monk fruit are recognized for their medicinal properties. In this study, a Sea buckthorn–monk beverage was produced via lactic acid bacteria (LAB) fermentation, and its phytochemicals, structural characteristics, and antioxidative potential and cytotoxic activity against hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) were examined. This beverage was fermented using Lactobacillus plantarum (LP), Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA), and Lactobacillus paracasei (LPC) as mono and co‐cultures. Compared to the control, all fermented samples exhibited a notable improvement in the beverage's bioactive content functional quality, with co‐culture fermentation exhibiting the best results. The highest total phenolic compounds, total flavonoids, total flavonols, proanthocyanidins, β‐carotene, and β‐glucan were observed in LP + LPC (1447.78 ± 1.61 mg/100 g), LA (718.14 ± 1.23 mg/100 g), LP + LA (130.44 ± 0.26 mg/100 g), LPC + LA (1844.49 ± 5.07 mg/100 g), LPC (16.68 ± 0.02 mg/100 g), LP + LPC (54.38 ± 0.16 mg/100 g) respectively. FTIR data showed the presence of high carotenoid esters, flavonoids, and the power of hydrogen bonding and boosted intermolecular covalent crosslinking, which explains the improvement in the fermented beverage. Antioxidative capacity also increased primarily in the co‐culture fermented samples as opposed to monoculture. Cytotoxicity of fermented beverages against HepG2 is noticeably high as compared to control. This shows anticancer potential of LAB fermented beverage against hepatocellular carcinoma. This research is kind of its own to combine fermentation technology with monk fruit enrichment to develop Sea buckthorn–monk beverage characterized by enhanced bioactive content and therapeutic potential.

         <title>Effect of Ultrasound‐Induced the Structural Changes in Casein on α‐Glucosidase Inhibitory Peptide of Its Hydrolysate</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
The effects of ultrasonic powers on casein structure and the α‐glucosidase inhibitory activity of casein hydrolysates were investigated. Potential α‐glucosidase inhibitory peptides generated from casein hydrolysate were identified by LC‐MS/MS and predicted by in silico. The action mechanism of the potential α‐glucosidase inhibitory peptides was further explored based on molecular docking. The results demonstrated that 300 W ultrasound treatment significantly enhanced fluorescence intensity and surface hydrophobicity (P &lt; 0.05), along with a decrease in particle size (P &lt; 0.05), an increase in zeta potential absolute value, and sulfhydryl contents (P &lt; 0.05) of casein. Concurrently, a significant decrease in α‐helix and β‐sheet content of casein was detected (P &lt; 0.05). Notably, the hydrolysate derived from 300 W ultrasound pretreatment casein exhibited a hydrolysis degree of 24.35% ± 1.28% and α‐glucosidase inhibitory activity of 57.43% ± 2.15%, both significantly higher than the untreated group (P &lt; 0.05). Three potential α‐glucosidase inhibitory peptides RYPSYGI, SRYPSYGLN, and YQKFPQYL displayed PeptideRanker scores above 0.5, low molecular weight, and were predicted to have good human intestinal absorption and be non‐toxic. Molecular docking revealed that binding energies with α‐glucosidase were −9.4, −8.6, and −7.4 kcal/mol, respectively. The identified peptides bound to amino acid residues within the active site of α‐glucosidase through hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions. In conclusion, ultrasonic pretreatment‐assisted enzymolysis was an effective technique for preparing α‐glucosidase inhibitory peptides from casein.

         <title>Classification of Biscuit Quality With Deep Learning Algorithms</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
This study aims to reduce time, costs, and human errors in quality control processes for biscuit production by employing deep learning models to detect defective products. Two datasets were created. One for binary classification (defect and no defect) and another for multi‐class classification (overcooked, texture defect, and not complete). Among the tested models, EfficientNet achieved the highest performance, with 93.89% accuracy, 96.74% precision, and a 95.38% F1 score in binary classification, and 95.03% accuracy in multi‐class classification. ResNet showed comparable performance with accuracy rates of 93.38% and 95.23% for the respective datasets. While XceptionNet and MobileNet exhibited slightly lower accuracy rates, they delivered competitive F1 scores, particularly in detecting texture defects. Grad‐CAM visualizations highlighted EfficientNet's superior focus on critical defect regions, reinforcing its suitability for industrial applications. These findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning models for efficient and precise quality control in industrial food production.

         <title>Effects of Hot Air Drying on the Nutritional and Phytochemical Composition of Radish (Raphanus sativus L.) Microgreens</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
Cruciferous microgreens are recognized for their high content of phytochemicals, particularly glucosinolates. Their high moisture content and water activity make them highly perishable after harvest and highlight the need for effective preservation methods that maintain their nutritional quality. This study evaluated the impact of hot air drying at 45°C, 65°C, or 95°C compared to freeze‐drying on the content and bioaccessibility of nutrients and phytochemicals in radish microgreens. Total phenolic content (TPC) and glucoraphenin (GE) exhibited opposite responses to heat: TPC decreased at 45°C (by 9%) and 65°C (21%), but did not change at 95°C, whereas GE decreased only at 95°C (by 21%). Vitamins B1 and B9 were stable across drying treatments, whereas vitamins B2, B3, and C were reduced by up to 35%, 36%, and 63%, respectively, with the exposure to the three temperatures. The in vitro bioaccessibility of TPC and vitamins B1, B3, B9, and C ranged from 13% to 68% and did not differ between drying treatments. The bioaccessibility of vitamin B2 was higher in samples dried at 65°C compared to the other treatments. GE and monomeric anthocyanin content (MAC) could not be quantified following in vitro digestion. The overall metabolomes of the samples were compared by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Partial least squares‐discriminant analysis (PLS‐DA) showed separation by drying treatment, with glucosinolates and flavonoids driving the separation. Overall, this research indicates that hot air drying represents an effective approach for postharvest nutrient preservation in radish microgreens and may facilitate the use of radish microgreen powder in formulated foods.

         <title>Assessment of Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) Regarding Food Allergen Labeling Among Allergic Population in Jiangxi Province, China</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Food allergy is an increasing global public health concern, posing significant challenges to individual well‐being and food safety. Effective management of food allergies relies heavily on the avoidance of allergens, making food allergen labeling a critical tool for allergic consumers. This study investigates the Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) of food allergen labeling among allergic consumers in Jiangxi Province, China, with a particular focus on behavioral and motivational aspects influencing allergen avoidance. Offline questionnaire surveys were conducted with allergic individuals recruited from randomly selected hospitals across Jiangxi Province. A systematic analysis of 794 valid responses revealed that the overall KAP levels related to food allergen labeling were suboptimal, with only 31.94% of food allergic respondents achieving a satisfactory health education evaluation. In the food‐allergic group, education and income were the primary influencing factors. Among non‐food‐allergic allergic individuals, KAP scores were influenced by gender, age, education, and family history of food allergy. Moreover, confusion over allergen labeling content and difficulty in understanding precautionary allergen labeling were major barriers to effective use. These findings highlight critical gaps in consumer's KAP regarding allergen labeling in Jiangxi Province and underscore the necessity of targeted educational interventions and improved labeling practices. This study provided a regionalized perspective that can inform future tailored strategies to mitigate food allergy risks and improve public health outcomes.

         <title>Unveiling the Impact of Infrared Drying on the Quality of Coffee Leaves: A Comprehensive Analysis of Physicochemical Indices, Antioxidant Potential, Maillard Reaction Products, and Aroma Profile</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
Coffee leaves, known for their health‐promoting phytochemicals, have emerged as a potential functional tea ingredient. However, the effect of infrared drying (IFD) on its properties and sensory quality remains unexplored, limiting its industrial utilization. This study systematically elucidated the impact of IFD on drying kinetics, chemical compositions, Maillard reaction products (MRPs), flavor formation, and sensory characteristics of coffee leaves. IFD significantly reduced drying time by more than 50% and decreased protein loss by more than 5.79% compared to hot‐air drying, while increasing total phenolic content (27.86% increase at 1300 W) and antioxidant activity (more than 50% increase). However, IFD resulted in higher levels of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural and α‐dicarbonyl intermediates (glyoxal and methylglyoxal) compared to freeze‐drying. Volatile analysis using HS‐SPME‐GC‐MS revealed distinct aroma profiles: freeze‐dried leaves showed a grassy aroma primarily characterized by hexanal, whereas IFD generated a more fruity‐floral aroma with elevated levels of (E)‐2‐hexen‐1‐ol, octanal, and thermally derived pyrazine/pyridine. Key flavor markers such as 2,3‐pentanedione and 6‐methyl‐5‐hepten‐2‐one were uniquely elevated in IFD blades. The sensory evaluation confirmed that IFD‐processed tea leaves received a score of 71.18 ± 3.04 and were characterized by a black tea‐like flavor with caramel and fermented undertones. These findings suggest IFD as a time‐ and energy‐efficient method to produce coffee leaf tea with dual advantages: (1) enhanced retention of bioactive compounds and (2) targeted generation of consumer‐desired sensory attributes through controlled MRPs. These findings establish a scientific basis for scaling up IFD processing, offering the tea industry a sustainable approach to valorizing coffee leaves into value‐added functional products.


Practical Application
Infrared drying offers coffee leaf tea producers a faster, energy‐saving method to create flavorful functional teas. It enhances antioxidant activity while developing appealing caramel and fruity notes similar to black tea, providing consumers with a nutritious beverage option. This technique enables sustainable upcycling of coffee leaves into premium tea products with consistent quality for commercial markets.

         <title>Palygorskite Clay Supported With EDTA for the Selective Removal of Aflatoxins From Peanut Oil</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
Palygorskite clay (Pal) treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was employed as an innovative adsorbent to remove aflatoxins from edible oils. The structural characteristics of EDTA‐modified Pal adsorbent were analyzed using characterization techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiments, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and x‐ray diffraction patterns. The modified Pal exhibited superior adsorption performance, at 0.3% of the adsorbent, the aflatoxin concentration of peanut oil (82.57 µg/kg) could be reduced to below the European Union limit value (≤4 µg/kg). The removal of AFB1 by EDTA‐modified Pal was as high as 98.74%, an enhancement of 13.06% compared to raw Pal. Nutrient components were also analyzed, and the retention of tocopherols and sterols in the oil treated with modified Pal increased by 6.36% and 13.67%, respectively, which suggests the prepared composite adsorbent had high selectivity. Finally, the adsorption process was analyzed using adsorption isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics. The process fitted better with the Langmuir model and the pseudo‐second‐order kinetic model, indicating that the adsorption process was mainly chemisorption. Thermodynamic results showed a spontaneous endothermic process. This research provided a novel idea for developing new adsorbents with high selectivity and low cost.

The modified Pal exhibited superior adsorption performance, at 0.3% of the adsorbent, the aflatoxin concentration of peanut oil (82.57 µg/kg) could be reduced to below the European Union limit value (≤4 µg/kg). The removal of AFB1 by EDTA-modified Pal was as high as 98.74%, an enhancement of 13.06% compared to raw Pal. Nutrient components were also analyzed, and the retention of tocopherols and sterols in the oil treated with modified Pal increased by 6.36% and 13.67%, respectively, which suggests the prepared composite adsorbent had high selectivity. Finally, the adsorption process was analyzed using adsorption isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics. The process fitted better with the Langmuir model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating that the adsorption process was mainly chemisorption. Thermodynamic results showed a spontaneous endothermic process. This research provided a novel idea for developing new adsorbents with high selectivity and low cost.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

ABSTRACT
The rapid spoilage of Pacific white shrimp poses significant challenges in maintaining quality during storage and transportation. This study evaluated the efficacy of Kiam wood extract (KWE), recognized for its antimicrobial properties and high antioxidant activity, as a natural preservative to extend the shelf life of shrimp. Headless and deveined shrimp samples were artificially inoculated with Shewanella sp., a common spoilage bacterium, and treated with KWE at varying concentrations (0%, 0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.6%). The treated shrimp were stored at 4°C for 9 days, during which the abundance of Shewanella sp., lipid oxidation (measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARs]), pH, protein degradation (total volatile base nitrogen [TVB‐N]; trimethylamine nitrogen [TMA‐N]), and fatty acid stability were monitored. The results revealed that shrimp treated with KWE exhibited significant reductions in spoilage markers compared to the control groups. The proportion of Shewanella sp. in KWE‐treated shrimp was over 20 times lower than that in untreated controls. Furthermore, KWE treatment significantly inhibited protein and lipid degradation, as indicated by reduced levels of TMA‐N, TVB‐N, and TBARs, while maintaining a more stable pH throughout storage. Notably, a KWE concentration of 0.6% demonstrated the highest efficacy in stabilizing key fatty acids, thereby preserving the nutritional quality of Pacific white shrimp throughout refrigerated storage. These findings highlight the potential of KWE as a natural and sustainable preservative for improving the storage stability of Pacific white shrimp, offering a viable alternative to synthetic additives in the seafood industry.


Practical Application
Kiam wood extract (KWE) helps extend the freshness of shrimp by reducing spoilage bacteria and slowing the breakdown of proteins and fats. Even at a low concentration of 0.2%, KWE improves shrimp quality, with the best results observed at 0.6%. Seafood processors can use KWE as a natural alternative to synthetic preservatives, offering a cleaner label and higher‐quality shrimp.

         <title>Challenges to Insect‐Based Food Acceptance: An Analysis of Neophobia Exploring Cognitive Aspects of the Mexican Consumers</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
The rising interest in alternative proteins has led to exploring insects as a sustainable option, but food neophobia hinders acceptance. This study analyzed insect‐based food neophobia among 620 Mexican consumers via an online survey, considering emotions, memories, protein type, gender, and consumer context. A Google Forms questionnaire assessed neophobia based on cognitive dimensions, with high reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.93–0.94). ANOVA revealed that protein type and gender significantly influenced emotions, while protein type, gender, and consumer context affected memory recall. Men experienced more emotions and memories than women, and urban consumers recalled more memories than rural ones. Both genders associated insect‐based food with negative memories. Cognitive mapping showed that insect‐based food elicited negative emotions (disgust, aggression, worry, wildness, boredom) and memories (disease, poverty, pain, accidents, stench, hurt, conflict). These results highlight the need to address cognitive factors to improve consumer acceptance of insect‐based food as a sustainable food source.
Practical Application: This research helps food producers and marketers understand the psychological barriers to insect‐based food acceptance among Mexican consumers. By identifying key emotions and memories linked to neophobia, companies can develop targeted strategies—such as educational campaigns or product reformulation—to improve consumer perception. These insights can support the sustainable food industry in making insect‐based proteins more appealing and accessible.

         <title>A Review of Processing, Marketing, and Demographic Influence on Consumer Perception of Pulse Milk‐ Insights From Traditional and AI‐Facilitated Research</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
Sustainable, healthy, and environmental concerns are part of the reasons consumers are shifting to plant‐based diets, such as plant‐based milk, which has reduced greenhouse gas emissions and water footprint as an advantage over animal‐based diets. Pulse crops such as lentils, lupins, chickpeas, and peas offer nutritious and health benefits, containing proteins, dietary fiber, and low‐fat content, as well as soil health restoration and cropping diversification as environmental benefits. Pulse milk is gaining popularity as one of the broader plant‐based milk categories that offer beneficial dairy alternatives. This review summarizes the impact of processing, marketing, and demographic variables and how they influence consumer perception of pulse milk. We also highlighted insights from artificial intelligence (AI) and traditional research methods to understand consumer choices. The consumer acceptance of pulses faces some challenges despite their benefits, related to sensory attributes such as beany, earthy, and grassy off‐flavors and the lack of culinary knowledge amongst consumers. The lower government subsidies for pulses compared to common crops and the lack of sustainability benefits awareness by some consumers limit pulse crop production. Advanced processing techniques like enzymatic treatments and homogenization can enhance pulse milk sensory quality. Marketing strategies tailored to target different demographics can encourage consumption. When developing a food product, analyzing relationships becomes difficult when there are multi‐faceted variables to consider. The gap in traditional research methods can be bridged with AI‐facilitated methods in predicting consumer preferences in product development. Further research is needed to enhance the nutritional and sensory quality of pulse milk.

Abstract
This study analyzed and compared the functional, flow, thermal, structural, and morphological properties of halim seed (Lepidium sativum) flours sourced from three distinct geographical regions in India. Significant (p &lt; 0.05) differences were observed in most evaluated properties among the flour samples. Bulk density (BD), tapped density (TD), true density, and porosity ranged from 414.00–431.10 kg/m3, 663.10–683.95 kg/m3, 1130.00–1152.22 kg/m3, and 61.85–64.07%, respectively, with all flours demonstrating poor flow ability. Water absorption capacity (WAC) (8.35–9.80 g/g) and oil absorption capacity (OAC) (1.04–1.17 g/g) varied significantly across cultivars (p &lt; 0.05). HS‐2 flour exhibited the highest water absorption index (WAI) (15.01 g/g) and swelling power (SP) (0.17 g/g). Foaming capacity (FC) (3.50–5.00%) and emulsifying capacity (EC) (43.02–44.22%) showed no significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) among the samples. Particle size analysis revealed HS‐2 flour as having the smallest median diameter (644.97 µm). Thermal analysis indicated peak transition temperatures between 64.80°C and 69.39°C, with HS‐2 flour showing the highest value. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra highlighted prominent peaks at 2800–3000 cm−1 and 1744 cm−1, while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed a granular microstructure with oil‐bearing globules and irregular protein particles. X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis identified A‐type crystallinity in all flours, with HS‐2 displaying the highest crystallinity (22.78%). Principal component analysis (PCA) and Pearson correlation demonstrated significant interrelationships among the evaluated properties. These findings highlight the diverse techno‐functional properties of halim seed flours, underscoring their potential as valuable ingredients in functional food applications.
Practical application: The findings of this study highlight the potential of Indian halim (Lepidium sativum) seed flours as functional ingredients in food formulations. Their techno‐functional properties suggest applicability in bakery, dairy, and meat analog products. Additionally, their thermal stability and structural characteristics support incorporation into heat‐processed foods, including soups, sauces, and gluten‐free formulations. These properties also indicate potential utilization in texture‐modifying applications, contributing to product stability and sensory appeal. Hence, Halim seed flours could serve as promising ingredients for functional and health‐oriented food products, catering to the growing demand for plant‐based and nutritionally enriched foods.

         <title>Astragalus membranaceus Extracts Can Serve as a Ketogenic Diet to Alleviate Chemotherapy Adverse Reactions Induced by Cyclophosphamide</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
The traditional ketogenic diet (KD) can cause side effects when applied in preventing chemotherapy adverse reactions (CARs) due to its unique dietary structure. This study aims to confirm that Astragalus membranaceus (HQ) can serve as a novel ketogenic approach and can be utilized to alleviate cyclophosphamide (CTX) induced CARs. After quantitatively analyzing the main components of HQ extracts, we demonstrated that oral administration of HQ extracts (3.2 g/kg) for 14 days effectively increased blood ketone body levels (648 nmol/mL) and β‐hydroxybutyrate levels (479 nmol/mL) in rats while alleviating CTX (30 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection for 5 consecutive days) that induced hematopoietic dysfunction and immune organ damages (evaluated via blood cell counts, histological examination, spleen index, and related inflammatory factors). Western blot results suggested that the mechanisms might involve the inhibition of caspase‐1 activation and the expression of IL‐1β and IL‐18. Furthermore, compared to the KD, HQ extracts did not cause adverse reactions such as weight loss or diarrhea while exerting ketogenic effects. This study investigates the mechanisms by which HQ alleviates CARs from a ketogenic perspective and confirms its potential as natural functional food materials used in ketogenesis and the treatment of related diseases.


Practical Application
This research proved that, compared to the traditional KD, HQ exhibited ketogenesis without altering the normal dietary structure and showed fewer adverse reactions. In terms of applications, HQ extracts significantly alleviated CARs. Consequently, HQ has the potential to be utilized as natural functional food materials for ketogenesis and could be employed in clinical complementary treatments, such as alleviating CARs.

         <title>Exploring the Potential of Lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) Flour‐Based Ingredients in Developing High Moisture Meat Analogues</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
The rising demand for sustainably and ethically produced alternatives to animal protein‐rich foods has driven interest in plant‐based meat analogues. This study evaluated the potential of lupin flour (LF), protein isolate (LPI), and their blends with soy protein isolate (SPI) to produce high‐moisture meat analogues (HMMAs) through extrusion cooking. Six SPI‐LF‐LPI blends, with protein contents ranging from 64.5% to 80.5%, were extruded under three feed moisture contents (FMC) of 60%, 65%, and 70%. Increasing LF content affected the textural attributes of the HMMAs, reducing their hardness, chewiness, and gumminess. The peak force to cut the HMMAs in longitudinal and transverse directions ranged from 3.3 to 10 N, with the softest textures observed for blends containing relatively higher LF and LPI and at the higher FMC level of 70%. In vitro protein digestibility of the HMMAs improved with increasing FMC, reaching a maximum proteolysis degree of 51.5% for the blend containing 55% SPI and 45% LF produced at 70% FMC. Although extrusion reduced the antioxidant capacity of the HMMAs compared to their raw counterparts, the antioxidant capacity of the HMMAs increased as the FMC level increased. These findings highlight the feasibility of using lupin ingredients to produce nutritionally rich and texturally appealing plant‐based meat analogues when extrusion conditions are fine‐tuned.

         <title>Exploring the Potential of Flour and Protein Concentrate From Richlea Lentils in the Development of Couscous With a Pilot‐Scale Twin‐Screw Extruder</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
Lentil couscous was developed with different ratios of lentil protein concentrate to lentil flour and different extruder screw speeds using a twin‐screw pilot scale extruder at a dry feed rate of 10 kg/h and a water feed rate of 3 kg/h. An analysis of the bulk density, the water absorption index, instrumental texture (hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, and resilience) was conducted for all 12 formulations. Five lentil couscous formulations were then presented to 120 participants to evaluate sensory properties (sensory acceptance in terms of overall liking, appearance liking, flavor liking, and texture liking, as well as check all that apply) and purchasing indicators (purchase intent and willingness to pay). An increase in the ratio of lentil protein concentrate to lentil flour from 0:100 to 40:60, decreased the water absorption index from 5.58 to 4.29, and consequentially decreased the springiness, cohesiveness, chewiness, and resilience texture. Higher overall liking, appearance liking, flavor liking, and texture liking for couscous presented to participants were observed for the formulations with lentil protein concentrate levels at 20% or less and a screw speed of 250–300 rpm. Check all that apply tests revealed nutty and a nutty aftertaste positively impacted flavor and overall liking (p &lt; 0.05) while grainy texture attribute negatively impacted the texture and overall liking (p &lt; 0.05).

         <title>Innovative Integration of Duckweed Proteins: Enhancing the Nutritional and Textural Properties of Snack Bars, Roll Breads, and Muffins Enhancing Baked Goods With Duckweed Protein</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
Duckweed, a fast‐growing aquatic plant rich in high‐quality protein, has emerged as a sustainable and alternative vegan protein source for food applications. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of duckweed protein concentrate (DPC) incorporation on the physical, chemical, and textural properties of snack bars, roll breads, and muffins. Based on preliminary optimization studies, DPC was added at levels of 12.5% in snack bars, 5% in roll breads, and 10% in muffins. Its inclusion significantly decreased the lightness (L*) values of all products, with the most pronounced reduction observed in roll bread crumb (54.5%) and snack bars (34.8%). Protein contents increased by 41%, 28%, and 12% in snack bars, roll breads, and muffins, respectively, improving their nutritional profiles. Chlorophyll content rose substantially—up to 18.8‐fold in roll breads—along with notable increases in total phenolic and flavonoid contents, enhancing antioxidant capacity. A significant increase in hardness was observed in all products, especially in snack bars. These results suggest that DPC can be effectively used as a functional ingredient in bakery and snack products to boost their nutritional and functional value.


Practical Application
Duckweed protein concentrate can be used to enhance the nutritional profile of bakery and snack products by increasing protein, chlorophyll, and antioxidant contents. Its incorporation offers a sustainable plant‐based protein alternative, making it a promising ingredient for the development of functional food products.

         <title>Enhanced Hydration, Solubility, and Structural Properties of Corn Insoluble Dietary Fiber via Optimized Radiofrequency and Enzymatic Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
Native corn insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) exhibits limited functionality due to its coarse structure and low hydration properties. Conventional treatments often compromise nutrient integrity or leave chemical residues. This study introduces a synergistic radiofrequency (RF) and enzymatic hydrolysis (EH) approach to enhance IDF functionality sustainably. Optimized RF parameters (17,647.06 W/m2 power density, 1750.81 W/kg adjusted SAR, 136.183 kV/m electric field intensity) preconditioned the fiber matrix, reducing median particle size by 39% (320.88 → 196.32 µm) and doubling specific surface area (0.0309 to 0.0744 m2/g), thereby enhancing enzymatic efficiency. The combined RF + EH treatment outperformed EH alone, increasing soluble dietary fiber (SDF) by 50% (4.2% vs. 3.6%) and reducing IDF content to 42.4% (vs. 43.0% for EH). It uniquely balanced hydration (moisture content: 8.94% vs. 7.51% for EH) and structural integrity, preserving crystallinity while increasing amorphous regions for improved water‐holding capacity (4.96% vs. 3.09% control) and fermentability. Compared to alkaline/thermal methods, RF + EH eliminated chemical residues and minimized nutrient loss. Color analysis confirmed structural modifications (ΔE = 14.59), while XRD and SEM validated enhanced porosity and retained mechanical strength. This method offers a scalable, energy‐efficient alternative for producing functional fibers suited for nutraceuticals and high‐fiber foods, addressing industrial needs for cost‐effective and sustainable dietary fiber modification.

         <title>Whey Protein Mitigates Oxidative Stress Injury and Improves Protein Synthesis in Mouse Skeletal Muscle by Regulating the SIRT1/Nrf2/HO‐1 Axis and AMPK/TSC2/mTOR/4EBP1 Pathway</title>

ABSTRACT
Whey protein (WP) can improve muscle mass and strength. However, its effects and underlying molecular mechanism in promoting recovery from muscle damage caused by excessive physical exercise remains unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of WP on skeletal muscle injury caused by exogenous oxidants and excessive physical exercise and the potential underlying mechanism. An oxidative stress injury model of mouse skeletal muscle cells was established using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and excessive physical exercise. The results revealed that WP effectively improved the migration and differentiation of C2C12 cells exposed to H2O2. Moreover, WP significantly increased the body weight of mice following excessive physical exercise. It also reduced food intake, improved behavioral parameters, enhanced skeletal muscle morphology and function, and promoted protein synthesis, thereby alleviating oxidative stress injury in skeletal muscles. The results further indicated that the mechanism underlying the mitigation of oxidative stress injury in skeletal muscles may involve the silent information regulator sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/ NF‐E2‐related factor‐2 (Nrf2)/ hemeoxygenase‐1 (HO‐1) axis. This axis could, in turn, activates the AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK)/tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 2 (TSC2)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/4E‐binding protein 1 (4EBP1) pathway, thereby promoting protein synthesis and improving the physiological function of skeletal muscles. This study provides important insights into the role of WP in promoting recovery from muscle damage, offering a basis for future research on WP‐based nutritional intervention strategies.

         <title>Exploring Plant Agro‐Industrial By‐Products as a Source of Fibrous Food Ingredients: A Review of Extraction Methods and Technological Properties</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
The agro‐industrial sector generates a large amount of by‐products, and researchers have been seeking new ways to use them, especially those of plant origin. The concept of biorefinery and circular bioeconomy aims to enhance and maximize the use of organic ingredients, emphasizing the use of renewable and sustainable materials. Many by‐products are rich in both macro and micronutrients, making them attractive for reuse and the development of new products. Plant fibers, composed of sclerenchyma cells, are an important example and are classified according to their origin. The use of food processing by‐products as a source of fiber has great potential to reduce waste and improve nutritional value. Industrial interest in plant fibers is growing, making them a viable alternative to traditional ingredients. These fibers, originating from agro‐industrial by‐products, have proven profitable for food enrichment. This review examines the current state of the art in recovering and applying fibrous by‐products, highlighting methods for obtaining them, their technological properties, and potential future applications. Furthermore, the conditions for modifying agro‐industrial waste are analyzed, and the importance of understanding the original fibrous matrix is emphasized to select the most suitable transformation process, thereby ensuring a high‐quality final product.

         <title>Evaluation of Frying Performance, Storage Stability, and In Vitro Digestion of Extra Virgin Olive Oil‐Candelilla Wax Oleogel</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
The present study investigates the stability of an oleogel developed from extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and candelilla wax (CDW) as a frying medium, including its 90‐day storage stability under dark and light conditions and its effects on in vitro digestion. The findings of the chemical analyses indicated that the gel structure and its storage in darkness effectively reduced oxidation, whereas exposure to light accelerated oxidative degradation. In addition, the oleogel, when utilized as a frying medium, exhibited superior stability compared to EVOO. Furthermore, the oil absorption rate of sliced potatoes fried in EVOO was 14.51%, which was lower (p &lt; 0.05) at 10.29% in potatoes fried in the oleogel. It was observed that during in vitro digestion, the gel structure reduced the interaction between lipase and oil, thereby slowing the formation rate of free fatty acids (FFA). As a result, the lipolysis rates in EVOO and the oleogel were 54% and 44%, respectively. Following in vitro digestion, α‐tocopherol bio accessibility was determined to be 98% and 94% in EVOO and the oleogel, respectively, while bioavailability rates were 16% and 34%, respectively. The bio accessibility of β‐carotene was found to be 53% and 41% for EVOO and the oleogel, respectively, while the bioavailability of β‐carotene was 6% and 3%, respectively. These results indicate that the oleogel structured with CDW offers significant advantages in terms of storage stability and effectiveness as a frying medium. At the same time, the gel structure demonstrated a notable influence on the digestion of the components in EVOO.

         <title>Effect of Inulin and Bacillus coagulans T242 on the Microbiological, Textural, and Physicochemical Properties of Fermented Milk</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
Inulin is considered a natural water‐soluble dietary fiber, while Bacillus coagulans (B. coagulans) possesses the ability to break down lactose. This study investigates the effects of inulin and B. coagulans T242 (T242) on the microbiological, textural, and physicochemical properties of fermented milk stored at 4°C for 21 days. The fermented milk produced using traditional starters, specifically Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, served as the control group (CFM). Multiple indicators, including viable bacterial count, pH, titratable acidity, water holding capacity (WHC), lactose content, textural properties, rheological properties, and microstructure, were measured. The results indicated that, compared to CFM, the fermented milk with inulin alone (ICFM) significantly increased WHC and viscosity, while reducing hardness and lactose content, and delaying microbial growth and post‐acidification. Compared to CFM, the fermented milk with T242 alone (TFM) promoted the growth of lactic acid bacteria while decreasing WHC, viscosity, hardness, and lactose content, and delaying post‐acidification. The combined addition of T242 and inulin in fermented milk (ITFM) delayed the growth of lactic acid bacteria, enhanced cohesiveness and viscosity, reduced hardness, improved the WHC of the network structure of milk protein, and refined the microstructure of the fermented milk, despite this group exhibiting the highest lactose content during the later storage period. In summary, inulin can enhance the quality of fermented milk, T242 can reduce lactose content, but their combined use has an adverse effect on lactose breakdown.

         <title>Optimization of the Spray‐Drying of the Traditional Ecuadorian Horchata for Developing an Instant Powdered Functional Beverage</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
Horchata lojana is a traditional beverage from Loja, Ecuador, made from a blend of medicinal and aromatic plants known for their health benefits. Despite its cultural and nutritional value, it has not been commercialized in powdered form, limiting its availability and convenience. This study aimed to develop powdered horchata through spray drying and optimize key parameters, the air inlet temperature (120–130°C), encapsulating agent (gum arabic, maltodextrin), and total solids concentration (5–8%).
Twelve experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of these factors on yield and solubility. The best results were obtained with maltodextrin at 5%, total solids at 8% and 120°C–130°C, achieving a 75.51% yield, 88–96% solubility, 4.38% moisture, and pH between 4.20 and 4.76. The powdered horchata was validated by sensory analysis showed high acceptance in taste, color, and aroma. Although Total phenol content and antioxidant capacity decreased after spray drying, values remained comparable to or higher than those in similar powdered products. Effective interactions between encapsulating agents and compounds contained in the beverage were confirmed by FTIR analysis, while through GC‐MS analysis linalool and geraniol were identified as key volatile compounds. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of spray drying for producing powdered horchata with good solubility, sensory quality, and functional properties. This study addresses a gap in the literature on traditional medicinal beverages for their commercialization in a stable, convenient format, while preserving part of their health benefits.


Practical Application
Horchata lojana is a traditional beverage produced from a blend of medicinal plants. It is currently sold both nationally and internationally in bottles as ready‐to‐drink liquid and in bags of dehydrated plant blend for further preparation. Therefore, the availability of horchata powder could reduce shipping costs and make consumption easier, as the powder dissolves easily in hot or cold water.

         <title>Evaluation of Moisture Sorption Isotherms and Storage Stability of Agglomerated Boza Powder</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
This study evaluated moisture sorption properties and storage stability of agglomerated boza powders as a cereal‐based potential probiotic instant product. Moisture adsorption isotherms of powders were determined at 10°C, 25°C, and 40°C, and the obtained curves were characterized by Type III isotherms. Of the four models, GAB was found to be the most suitable for describing the sorption of powders over the entire range of water activity. The differential entropy values of boza powder were calculated as 16.23 and 2.68 j/mol K at 1% and 20% moisture content, respectively. As observed in isosteric sorption heat values, the differential entropy of boza powder tended to decrease with increasing equilibrium moisture content. Changes in some agglomerated boza powder quality characteristics were determined during 6‐month storage at room temperature using glass and aluminum‐laminated polyethylene (ALPE) packaging materials. Based on the kind of material utilized for packaging, LAB cell survival and some quality parameters, including moisture content, water activity, pH and titratable acidity, ΔE value, particle density, porosity, loose and tapped bulk density, wettability, solubility, flowability, cake strength, cohesion index, and thermal property of the powder changed to varying degrees while being stored. The results showed that glass packaging provides the best protection and is used for long‐term storage of agglomerated boza powder.

         <title>Chemical Constituents of Rabdosia Species and Their Antimicrobial and Antioxidant Activities in Extending Meat Shelf Life</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
Food spoilage causes significant economic losses and poses severe risks to public health. Therefore, the development of effective antimicrobial agents, preservatives, and food additives is urgently required. The seedlings and tender leaves of Rabdosia species (locally called Xiang Cha Cai) are well‐known vegetables in East Asia and have the effects of eliminating heat and dampness. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of 104 fractions from 13 Rabdosia species, isolating and characterizing seven bioactive constituents (SZ‐05, BY‐05, XY‐01, XY‐04, YH‐02, GM‐02, and XZ‐05) and evaluating their antimicrobial activities. Through a bioactivity‐guided principal component analysis (PCA), three bioactive compounds—oridonin, lasiokaurin, and abietic acid—were identified and characterized by examining the relationships between chemical compositions and their bioactivity. The antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the studied bioactive fractions and compounds ranged from 16 to 128 µg/mL. A synergistic effect (ε̃&lt;−0.5; fractional inhibitory concentration index ≤0.5) was observed between oridonin and vitexin against vancomycin‐resistant Enterococcus. The oridonin‐vitexin combination removed the biofilm and caused changes in the surface structure of the bacteria. In addition, the bioactive Rabdosia irrorata fraction of 40% ethanol rinse macroporous resin (GM‐02) exhibited both antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, which contributed to prolonging the shelf life of ready‐to‐eat food. Experimental results demonstrate that GM‐02 has the potential to serve as a natural, non‐toxic, and environmentally safe antimicrobial agent and food preservative. These findings may effectively help reduce the incidence of foodborne diseases and improve the stability of food storage.

         <title>Combination of Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) and Vis/NIRs to Predict the Firmness of Crown Pears</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
With the improvement of people's living standards, consumers' requirements for fruit quality are constantly rising. Firmness, which is strongly associated with the maturity of fruits, is one of the most concerned fruit quality parameters. This study aimed to utilize Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) and Visible and Near‐Infrared Spectroscopy (Vis/NIRs) for the non‐destructive testing of the firmness of crown pears. Multiple pear firmness prediction models based on LDV and Vis/NIRs data were developed employing partial least squares (PLS), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and one‐dimensional convolutional neural network (1D‐CNN), and the prediction effects of these models were compared and analyzed. The experimental results demonstrate that the prediction models combining LDV and Vis/NIRs spectral data had significant advantages in accuracy compared with the prediction models using single LDV or Vis/NIRs data, and the 1D‐CNN prediction model built with the fusion of the two types of data as inputs have the best prediction results (R2P = 0.927, RMSEP = 0.678N/mm, RPDP = 3.378). This study demonstrates the brilliant performance and massive potential of the fusion of LDV and Vis/NIRs data in the application of fruit firmness prediction.

         <title>Antioxidant Films of Starch Blends With Onion Peel Extract for Packaging Coriander</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
Utilization of by‐products from food and vegetable processing has gained immense importance in recent times since the addition of their extracts into biopolymers yields active films. The added advantages include abundance, cost‐effectiveness, functionality, and their environmentally friendly nature. In the present work, active food packaging materials were developed by incorporating onion peel extract (OPE) in starch‐polyvinyl alcohol‐montmorillonite (starch‐PVA‐MMT) biopolymer films. The physicochemical, mechanical, thermal, surface, and antioxidant properties of the films were analyzed. The physical integrity of the starch‐PVA‐MMT films was conserved even after the addition of OPE. Cooperative interactions between the polymer matrix and OPE were revealed via FTIR and XRD analysis. OPE also conferred UV barrier attributes to the transparent starch‐PVA‐MMT films. After incorporation of OPE, while the elongation at break of the films increased by ∼16.85%, tensile strength reduced by 12.43%. FE‐SEM studies revealed significant alteration in the surface of the films; the roughness of the film increased notably and confirmed the interactions between the OPE and the polymer matrix. This also led to an increase in the contact angle of the films. Further, OPE induced significant antioxidant properties in the films, amounting to ∼97% in comparison to 0% for the control film. Additionally, OPE showed a profound effect on the biodegradability of the starch‐PVA‐MMT films. The films were used for packing coriander. Results revealed increased shelf life of coriander in terms of retaining moisture and color in comparison to unpacked material and commercial film of LDPE.
Practical Application: Antioxidant films of starch blends incorporated with onion peel extract (OPE) have been investigated as a potential innovation for sustainable packaging in the food industry. These films could be effectively used for reducing oxidative changes and microbial spoilage of perishable items such as coriander leaves. Films with two different concentrations of OPE (1.5 and 3 mL), i.e., 1.5 OPE and 3.0 OPE, were chosen for packaging as their overall properties were found to be superior. After biodegradation, the highest weight loss was observed for 4.5 OPE films, an increase of 33.33% in comparison to the control film. Moreover, their eco‐friendly and degradable nature aligns with the rising consumer demand for sustainable packaging.

         <title>Conformation Changes and Flavor Binding Capacity of Myofibrillar Proteins Upon Different Amounts of Sugar Additions: Relating to the Processing of Cantonese Sausage</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Sugar plays a crucial role in the processing of Cantonese sausages, endowed it unique flavor perceptions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sugar levels on the structure and flavor binding capacity of pork myofibrillar proteins (MPs) during the processing of Cantonese sausages. Results showed that sugar addition could significantly enhance the concentration of flavor compounds in Cantonese sausages, with ester emerging as the key aroma compounds. Moreover, 6% sugar addition generally showed the highest flavor concentration, which could be associated with the structural changes mediated by different sugar levels. Sugar addition could cause structural unfolding and reassembly to MPs, forming more loose structures with significant decrease in α‐helix and increase in β‐sheets. And the surface hydrophobicity first decreased and then increased with increasing in sugar content, peaking at 6% and 9% sugar addition. All these could affect the flavor adsorption capacity of MPs, showing improved adsorption capacity to alcohol and ketone compounds and releasing effect to ester and aldehyde compounds upon sugar addition. The driving force for the adsorption could be attributed to the exposure of the hydrophobic sites in MPs, which could reduce the surface tension and thus promote the adsorption of flavor compounds. The results obtained in this study provided theoretical basis and data support for the processing of low‐sugar Cantonese sausage with good flavor perception.

         <title>Impact of Deep Ocean Water on the Textural and Microstructural Properties of Soybean‐Based and Winged Bean‐Based Tofu</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
The coagulation behavior induced by deep ocean water (DOW) was critical in determining the textural and microstructural properties of tofu derived from soybean and winged bean proteins. In this study, soybean milk and winged bean milk were subjected to thermal denaturation, followed by the addition of 2.0% DOW as a coagulant to facilitate tofu formation. Textural profile analyses and penetration tests revealed distinct differences between the two tofu varieties. Winged bean‐based tofu exhibited a hardness of 1476.4 ± 89.2 g, springiness of 3.09 ± 0.20, breaking strength of 25.0 ± 2.9 N/m2, and deformation of 4.49 ± 1.29 mm. In comparison, soybean‐based tofu demonstrated higher hardness (2195.9 ± 86.5 g), lower springiness (0.99 ± 0.20), greater breaking strength (45.6 ± 2.5 N/m2), and increased deformation (7.78 ± 2.55 mm). Scanning electron microscopy revealed a honeycomb‐like microstructure in both tofu types; however, winged bean‐based tofu exhibited larger and more uniform pores, whereas soybean‐based tofu displayed an internal structure characterized by coagulated flocculent networks. These findings highlight the potential of winged beans as an alternative plant‐based protein source for gel formation and underscore the novel role of DOW as a coagulant in modulating the structural properties of tofu during production.

         <title>Evaluation of the Technological Properties of Dried Attieke Ferments</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
Drying traditional attieke ferments would be a promising solution to improve their preservation and long‐term availability. In this context, the three traditional types of ferments (braised, raw, and boiled) were dried at 37°C. The aim of this study was to determine the ideal inoculation dose for each type of dried ferment used in attieke production. To achieve this, fermentations were carried out with different inoculants (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%). The results showed that the best yields in terms of technological properties were obtained with dough inoculated with 10% traditional ferment and that inoculated with 15% dried ferment. Whatever the type of ferment used, the fermentative properties of dough inoculated with 15% dried ferment were better than those inoculated with 10% similar traditional ferment. After 24 h of fermentation, the dough inoculated at 15% with the dried raw ferment showed the highest acidity, reaching 1.01% ± 0.07%. Cassava doughs inoculated with 15% braised and dried boiled ferments showed acidities of 1% ± 0.1% and 0.75% ± 0.03%, respectively. Enzyme production peaks at 18 h of fermentation. Thus, dough inoculated with 15% dried braised ferment exhibited high α‐amylolytic (94.95 ± 3.9 U/mL) and β‐glucosidasic (65 ± 3.1 U/mL) activity. Dough inoculated with 15% boiled ferment showed a high level of pectinolytic activity (28.18 ± 0.9 U/mL). The technological properties of dried ferments were maximized for a 15% inoculation dose, after 18 h of fermentation at 35°C. These ferments could be selected for consistent quality attieke production in Côte d'Ivoire.

         <title>Lycopene Modulates Glycerophospholipid Metabolism and Promotes N‐Acylethanolamine Production to Alleviate Obesity</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT

Obesity is often associated with dysregulated glycerophospholipid metabolism. Lycopene is known for its anti‐obesity properties. However, the mechanism by which lycopene affects glycerophospholipid metabolism in obesity remains unclear. Here, a lycopene small intestinal sustained‐release system (SR‐Ly) was designed. Subsequently, SR‐Ly was used to interfere with fatty liver caused by high‐fat diet in mice. SR‐Ly exhibited high encapsulation efficiency, stability, and sustained release, significantly enhancing lycopene's bioavailability. Moreover, treatment with SR‐Ly resulted in reduced body weight gain in obese mice. Lipidomic analysis revealed significant modulation of glycerophospholipid pathways with lycopene increasing beneficial glycerophospholipids. Correlation‐based analysis further suggested that lycopene may promote the conversion of N‐acyl phosphatidylethanolamine to N‐acylethanolamines (NAE), highlighting a possible metabolic route of interest. Structural equation modeling supported the association between lycopene intervention and improved glycerophospholipid metabolism. Additionally, compared to lipid oxidation, it was verified at both the gene and protein levels that lycopene has a greater positive effect on lipid synthesis in the mouse liver. Hence, SR‐Ly is a promising therapeutic approach for fatty liver, effectively targeting glycerophospholipid metabolism.


Practical Application
SR‐Ly enhanced lycopene's stability, bioavailability, and sustained release. SR‐Ly reduced body weight gain and modulated glycerophospholipid metabolism. Lycopene promoted N‐acyl phosphatidylethanolamine conversion to N‐Acylethanolamines. Lycopene improved glycerophospholipid metabolism, favoring lipid synthesis over oxidation.

         <title>GOS‐Modulated Gut Microbiota in Mice Ameliorates Obesity in High‐Fat Diet‐Fed Mice Through the Gut‐Liver Axis and Bile Acid Pathway</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
This work is meant to study the effect of galacto‐oligosaccharide (GOS) intervention in the fecal microbiota of obese mice on lipid metabolism and anti‐obesity in mice. A pseudo‐germ‐free mice model was established by administration of a mixture of antibiotics. The fecal microbiota of GOS‐fed obese mice are transplanted into pseudo‐germ‐free mice. To investigate the effects of GOS intervention on lipid metabolism, lipid quadruple, bile acid metabolism, and intestinal microbiota in obese mice. At the same time, the expression of BAS synthase and the effects of FXR‐SHP and FXR‐FGF15‐FGFR4 signaling pathways on BAS homeostasis were also explored. The fecal microbiota of obese mice intervened by GOS could reshape the structure of intestinal microbiota, regulate the synthesis of bile acids in the enterohepatic circulation and the expression of transport‐related factors, and promote metabolic ability to exert anti‐obesity effects.

         <title>Application of Gamma Irradiation to Ensure Safety and Preserve the Quality of Fresh Blueberries (Emerald)</title>

ABSTRACT
This study aimed to evaluate the effect of gamma irradiation (0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 KGy doses) on rotavirus inactivation (RVA) and the quality of Esmerald fresh blueberries. Dosimetry measurements revealed absorbed doses of 0.72, 1.46, and 2.16 KGy. The D10 value for RVA inactivation was determined to be 3.03 ± 0.03 KGy, exceeding the maximum 2.5 KGy dose permitted for fresh fruit, indicating that gamma irradiation alone is insufficient for effective RVA inactivation without significantly impacting blueberry quality. On the other hand, the absorbed doses (0.72, 1.46, and 2.16 KGy) did not affect most of the physicochemical parameters or the nutritional profile. However, a dose‐dependent decrease in mechanical properties and enzyme activity was observed. Therefore, achieving effective RVA inactivation in fresh blueberries could require a combined approach, integrating gamma irradiation, ideally at doses up to 1.46 KGy, with complementary methods. This combined strategy could offer a promising intervention for the inactivation of RVA in fresh produce.


Practical Application
Blueberries, due to their specific characteristics, are particularly susceptible to viral contamination. Conventional sanitation methods, such as washing, are inadequate as they can affect the texture, integrity, and appearance of the fruit. Gamma irradiation is a non‐thermal preservation method that improves food safety and extends shelf life while causing minimal alterations to the natural attributes of fresh produce. According to our results, gamma irradiation showed potential to inactivate RVA in blueberries. However, to achieve complete inactivation, a dose higher than the allowed dose (2.5 KGy) is required. Furthermore, our study revealed that irradiation treatments with doses lower than 2.5 KGy had a negative impact on the mechanical properties of blueberries, while they had a limited impact on the inactivation of the enzyme. In this regard, further studies are needed to explore combined strategies that effectively inactivate RVA and enzymes without compromising the delicate quality of fresh produce.

         <title>A Dimensionless Empirical Model to Predict Heat Transfer Coefficients for Cooling High‐Moisture Meat Analog with Rectangular Dies</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
An empirical dimensionless relationship useful for estimating heat transfer coefficients during continuous cooling of high moisture meat analog (HMMA) in rectangular linear cooling dies is described here. This information is essential for designing better cooling dies, which is timely since the cooling rate has recently been demonstrated to be important in controlling the quality of HMMA. Wheat‐based HMMA was extruded as per an experimental design that varied cooling media temperature (36–72°C), product mass flow rate (2.7–4.5 kg/h), and die aspect ratios (a* = 0.28 or 0.45). In situ product and cooling media temperatures and mass flow rates were measured continuously using penetrative thermocouples and flow meters, respectively. Dimensional scaling of the underlying differential equations governing heat transfer for this system demonstrated a relationship between dimensionless Nusselt (Nu¯$\overline {{\mathrm{Nu}}}$), Graetz (Gz−1), and conduit aspect ratio (a*) numbers. Values for these numbers derived from the described experimental data were fit via nonlinear regression to a dimensionless model of the form Nu¯$\overline {{\mathrm{Nu}}}$ = A∙(Gz−1)B∙(C+D∙[1−a*]E) with a high degree of quality (root mean square error = Nu¯$\overline {{\mathrm{Nu}}}$ ± 4.9, p &lt; 0.0001). The resulting fit parameters were deemed reasonable given that the model was logically bound within theoretical Nusselt number limits. The model documented here allows for the estimation of heat transfer coefficients relevant to HMMA cooling dies, while also illustrating the effect of altering cooling die aspect ratios and heat exchanger lengths as would be considered when scaling up an HMMA process.


Practical Application
Carefully balanced cooling rates are essential for producing whole‐cut type meat analogs with a desirable texture and fibrous quality at an economically feasible scale. This work presents a useful model for estimating the required cooling rates of whole‐cut type meat analogs as a function of key processing criteria such as production rate and product size. Models like this would be useful for engineers and scientists attempting to optimize their meat analog processes, with such efforts ultimately resulting in reduced costs and improved quality associated with meat analog production.

         <title>Process Optimization and Storage Evaluation of Explosion Puffing Dried Reduced‐Fat White Cheese Snacks</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
This study builds on the previous research that explored the effects of different pre‐drying methods on the quality of reduced‐fat white cheese (RFWC) snacks before explosion puffing drying (EPD). The microwave + freeze hybrid drying (MD + FD) method was identified as the optimal pre‐drying approach, with a target moisture content of 45 g/100 g in the RFWC sample, based on textural, chemical, color, and sensory attributes. In this continuation study, the MD + FD pre‐drying method and moisture content were maintained, whereas response surface methodology (RSM) with a Box–Behnken design was applied to optimize the EPD process parameters for producing high‐protein RFWC snacks. The independent variables (puffing temperature, puffing time, and vacuum temperature) were evaluated for their effects on protein content, crispness, volumetric expansion, and sensory acceptability. Statistical analysis showed that vacuum temperature significantly influenced all responses; puffing time played a key role in protein content and crispness, whereas puffing temperature primarily affected volumetric expansion. The optimal EPD conditions were determined as 100°C puffing temperature, 5 min puffing time, and 60°C vacuum temperature, yielding a protein content of 60.33 g/100 g DM, crispness of 34.40, volumetric expansion of 16.60%, and an overall sensory score of 7.46. A 6‐month storage study revealed that the product retained its quality for 4 months, with noticeable moisture uptake, oxidation, and texture degradation from the fifth month onward. These findings highlight EPD's potential for developing high‐protein, crispy cheese snacks while underscoring the importance of selecting appropriate packaging to maintain product stability.


Practical Applications
By showing that explosion puffing drying (EPD) can be tuned to produce crispy, protein‐rich cheese snacks with exceptional texture and sensory appeal, this work contributes to the invention of high‐protein snacks. The findings provide the food industry a scalable way to create nutrient‐dense, shelf‐stable treats that are not manufactured with conventional grains. Additionally, the 6‐month storage analysis provides important information on packaging techniques to increase shelf life, increasing the viability of these snacks for mass manufacture and international distribution. The new generation of clean‐label, high‐protein snacks in the quickly expanding health‐conscious market is made possible by our research.

         <title>Replacing Sodium Tripolyphosphate in Frozen Shrimp Preservation: Soaking Treatments, Nonthermal Technologies, and Their Limitations</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

Abstract
Shrimp's nutrient‐rich composition and high water activity make it highly perishable, necessitating effective preservation methods like freezing. However, freezing induces undesirable changes, including protein denaturation, lipid oxidation, and reductions in water‐holding capacity (WHC), yield, and textural quality. Sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) is traditionally used to mitigate these effects due to its ability to stabilize proteins, enhance pH and ionic strength, and inhibit oxidation. Yet, STPP presents significant health, environmental, and regulatory challenges, prompting growing interest in sustainable alternatives. This review critically evaluates the effectiveness of STPP and its substitutes, including alkali metal compounds, polysaccharides, proteins, and their combinations. Each class exhibits distinct mechanisms such as ionic strength modulation, hydrogen bonding, and antioxidative activity to preserve shrimp muscle integrity. In addition, nonthermal technologies like ultrasound, vacuum tumbling, high‐pressure processing, pulsed electric field, and cold plasma show promise in improving soaking efficiency, structural retention, and oxidative stability. These technologies can enhance or complement the effects of soaking agents through physical, chemical, and enzymatic pathways. Despite promising results, challenges remain regarding the scalability, cost, sodium content, soaking durations, and limited shrimp‐specific validation of many treatments. Current findings highlight the need for optimized, clean‐label cryoprotective strategies that align with health regulations, environmental goals, and consumer preferences. Future efforts should focus on integrating effective compound combinations with advanced technologies to develop robust, industry‐ready solutions that ensure both product quality and sustainability in frozen shrimp processing.

         <title>The Effects and Molecular Mechanisms of Heat‐Assisted Thawing and Erythritol Addition on the Rheological Properties of Egg Yolk</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Egg yolk is a highly nutritious and multifunctional ingredient widely used in food industries. However, freezing‐induced gelation poses a significant challenge in the storage and processing of frozen egg yolk, leading to irreversible textural changes and limited industrial applications. This study investigated the synergistic effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of heat‐assisted thawing, as well as the addition of erythritol, on the rheological properties of egg yolk. The results indicated that the frozen egg yolk liquid thawed at 50°C exhibited the optimal fluidity, as demonstrated by a 133% increase in the flow index, when compared to that thawed at 25°C. The 50°C also thawed sample displayed smaller particle size and weaker intermolecular interactions, indicating that accelerated heating could effectively prevent the freezing gelation of egg yolk. The incorporation of erythritol could further suppress the freeze gelation of frozen egg yolk liquid, served to decrease the melting point of egg yolk (thereby further inhibiting recrystallization behavior) and weaken the hydrogen bond interactions among egg yolk protein molecules. The results were meaningful for providing guidance for the production of frozen egg yolk with good fluidity and functionality.

         <title>Synergistic Drying Solutions: Combining Vacuum and Infrared Techniques for Optimal Persimmon Preservation</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
This study evaluated vacuum drying (VD) and infrared drying (IRD) methods for persimmon, including individual and two‐step sequential processes (VD followed by IRD and vice versa). The combined drying strategies were selected to harness the rapid surface heating of IRD and the low‐temperature, low‐oxygen benefits of VD, aiming to overcome limitations of single drying methods such as extended drying times and nutrient degradation. Drying experiments were conducted using laboratory‐scale equipment at 50–70°C, for VD, with a vacuum pressure of 50 mbar (absolute pressure) and a pump speed of 2 L/s. Results showed a significant effect of drying combination strategies on drying rate, duration, effective moisture diffusivity, shrinkage, activation energy, color characteristics, microstructure, and phytochemical constituents of persimmon. The shortest drying times were recorded for IRD (240 min), followed by VD + IRD (343 min) and IRD + VD (376 min), whereas VD required the longest (520 min). Effective moisture diffusivity ranged from 1.42 × 10−9 m2/s for VD at 50°C (VD‐50) to 7.83 × 10−9 m2/s for IRD at 70°C (IRD‐70), with both individual IRD‐70 and a combination of IRD + VD demonstrating improved moisture transfer performance. The IRD + VD combination resulted in the best microstructure preservation and showed lower shrinkage compared to other drying strategies. Moreover, this combination best preserved the persimmon color with the lowest total color change (ΔE = 5.591), whereas VD showed the highest (ΔE = 35.875). Activation energy was lowest in IRD + VD (13.98 kJ/mol), followed by VD + IRD (18.61 kJ/mol), with higher values in VD (34.08 kJ/mol) and IRD (22.75 kJ/mol). Phytochemical analysis showed IRD (total phenolic content [TPC] = 35.79 mgGAE/g, total flavonoid content [TFC] = 54.83 mgQE/g) and IRD + VD (TPC = 17.02 mgGAE/g, TFC = 58.52 mgQE/g) retaining the highest bioactive compounds. This study contributes to optimizing drying techniques for persimmon, enhancing energy efficiency, preserving nutritional quality, and supporting sustainable food processing, making it relevant for the food industry, food engineering, and food science fields.

         <title>Antiproliferative Effects of Fractionated Crude Lectins From Boiled Japanese Taro Tubers (Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott)</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
Lectins are carbohydrate‐binding proteins with diverse biological functions, including antitumor and immunomodulatory activities. Taro (Colocasia esculenta) tubers, commonly consumed in cooked form, are a potential bioactive lectin source; however, the effects of thermal processing on their functionality remain insufficiently understood.
This study investigated the biological profiles of lectins fractionated from both raw and boiled Japanese taro tubers (JTT). Lectins were fractionated using carboxymethyl‐Sepharose and diethylaminoethyl‐Sepharose chromatography, depending on their solubility following thermal treatment. To simulate dietary conditions, crude (unpurified) lectin fractions were analyzed directly without further purification. Hemagglutination assays revealed that lectins from both raw and boiled JTT recognized thyroglobulin and fetuin, while those from boiled JTT also exhibited specificity toward N‐acetylneuraminic acid. Boiled JTT lectins demonstrated reduced protease resistance and mitogenic activity compared to raw fraction, though mitogenicity remained lower than that of concanavalin A in mouse splenocyte cultures. Lectins from both sources demonstrated notable antiproliferative activity against multiple cancer cell lines, including HepG2, HeLa, B16, LM8, and Ehrlich ascites cells. Boiled taro lectins showed better activity in some cases, which suggests that they still have some bioactivity after being heated. Even after undergoing some structural changes from boiling, their ability to cause clumping of red blood cells and their specific interaction with carbohydrates remained unchanged. This means that certain useful properties of taro lectins are still there. These results help us understand how we can use heated taro lectins as beneficial ingredients in medicine and functional foods.
Practical Application: Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott is a tuberous monocotyledonous plant that grows in tropical and subtropical climates. Lectins from raw and boiled Japanese tubers showed specificity for thyroglobulin and fetuin. Moreover, lectins fractionated from boiled samples showed specificity for N‐acetylneuraminic acid using mouse erythrocytes. They were resistant to proteases and exhibited antiproliferative activity against HepG2, HeLa, B16, LM8, and Ehrlich ascites cells. The crude fractions from raw and boiled tubers could stimulate splenocyte proliferation and inhibit TNF‐α, IL‐6, IL‐1β, and COX‐2 expressions. Thus, lectins from boiled tubers have the potential to be used as bioactive proteins in medical research.

         <title>Ultrasonic and enzymatic processing for optimizing gelation and functional properties of black bean protein isolate</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This study investigates the synergistic effects of ultrasonic and enzymatic treatments on the gelation properties of black bean protein isolate (BBPI). We hypothesize that this combined approach will enhance gelation by promoting structural modifications and molecular interactions. The results show that the combined treatment of ultrasound and enzymes effectively reduced the molecular weight of BBPI, facilitating protein dissociation and structural refolding. This process resulted in increased surface hydrophobicity, a significant reduction in particle size (by 85%), an increase in the absolute value of the zeta potential, and a 60% enhancement in solubility. These modifications led to a gel with improved viscoelasticity, increased water‐holding capacity, and enhanced gel strength and springiness, which reached 5.11 N and 4.73 mm, respectively, while forming a more compact three‐dimensional network structure. These findings suggest a promising strategy for improving BBPI for food applications, particularly in plant‐based products, by enhancing its functional properties and expanding its industrial potential.

         <title>Integration of PCA, HCA, and KNN to Evaluate Packaging and Storage Conditions for Red Bell Peppers</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
Peppers (Capsicum annuum L.) are a vegetable that is widely cultivated in various regions of the world. Despite the economic importance of peppers, their commercialization is hindered by their limited postharvest durability, primarily due to moisture loss during storage. This study evaluated the effectiveness of different packaging methods and storage conditions in preserving the physicochemical and morphological quality of peppers during 21 days. Six treatments were tested, combining two types of packaging (thermo‐sealable and macro‐perforated) with two storage conditions (8°C/95% RH and 25°C/60% RH), plus an unpackaged control. Variables assessed included color, soluble solids, pH, pigments, dimensions, and mass loss. Data were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and Kohonen neural networks (KNN). The first three principal components (PCs) explained 67.2% of total variance (PC1—40.88%, PC2—15.11%, PC3—11.17%). PC1 was strongly associated with mass and size losses (up to 73%), whereas PC2 and PC3 explained 77.4% of h* and 84.9% of C*, respectively. HCA and KNN revealed similar groupings. Samples stored at 8°C clustered together regardless of packaging, indicating minimal quality loss. At 25°C, unpackaged and macro‐perforated samples showed similar degradation. Thermo‐sealable packaging at 25°C formed a distinct cluster, indicating improved protection. This treatment also showed reduced quality losses, though not as effective as refrigeration. The agreement among PCA, HCA, and KNN confirms the reliability of findings. These results highlight the value of combining conservation strategies with multivariate tools to guide efficient, sustainable postharvest practices and extend shelf life in the pepper supply chain.


Practical Application
This study proposes a solution for the horticultural industry by combining heat‐shrink packaging and refrigeration for pepper preservation. This method significantly reduces physical and biochemical losses, extends shelf life, and maintains quality. It has the potential to transform the logistics of production and distribution, delivering fresh, high‐quality peppers. The use of advanced techniques like PCA and neural networks enables more informed and efficient decision‐making, allowing for customized preservation strategies. This approach meets the growing demand for fresh food, offering a sustainable, cost‐effective alternative for postharvest preservation, and may provide a competitive advantage in the global market.

ABSTRACT
The growing interest in natural alternatives to synthetic additives underscores the importance of plant‐based antioxidants. This study investigated the use of peixinho da horta (Stachys byzantina K. Koch) extract in fresh pork sausages. Five formulations were developed: one control with synthetic antioxidants (LC), one without antioxidants or extracts (LS), and three with natural extract at concentrations of 0.5% (LP1), 1.0% (LP2), and 2.0% (LP3). Physicochemical properties, including pH, color, water‐holding capacity (WHC), cooking weight loss (CWL), and lipid oxidation, were evaluated at three time points: Day 0 (24 h after production), Day 9, and Day 16. Significant differences were observed across all parameters. CWL ranged from 12% to 36.52%, and WHC ranged from 73.69% to 86.36%, with LP3 showing the highest CWL and lowest WHC. pH values ranged from 5.11 to 5.81, and although L* values remained similar, significant differences were observed for a* and b* values. For oxidative stability, LP1 and LP3 performed similarly to the control (LC), with thiobarbituric acid–reactive substance (TBARS) values ranging from 0.09 to 0.12 mg MDA kg−1. Among the formulations with natural extracts, LP1 (0.5%) was the most promising, offering oxidative stability comparable to the synthetic antioxidant while maintaining desirable physicochemical characteristics. The use of peixinho da horta extract as a natural antioxidant enhanced oxidative stability, improved color retention, and reduced reliance on synthetic additives. These findings highlight the potential of using natural extracts like peixinho da horta in the development of healthier, more sustainable meat products.

         <title>Docosahexaenoic Acid Isomerized Through [1,5] and [1,3] Sigmatropic Rearrangements During Deodorization Process: Perspective of Density Functional Theory</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
The isomerization of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is intricate, leading to DHA loss during the industrial deodorization process. In this research, deodorization parameters of algae oil were optimized on a laboratory scale, with recommendations for temperature not exceeding 190°C and duration no longer than 70 min. The formation of conjugated trienes and dienes was confirmed by infrared spectrum and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. To verify the formation process of conjugated trienes and dienes, density functional theory was employed. It was established that both [1,5] and [1,3] sigmatropic rearrangements transpired within this process. The [1,5] sigmatropic rearrangements exhibited lower activation energy than [1,3] counterparts, indicating that [1,5] sigmatropic rearrangements are more facile. This study validated the positional isomerization of DHA and offered valuable guidance for the algae oil production industry.


Practical Application
This study examines how DHA levels decrease during the refining process of algal oil. It suggests a temperature threshold of 190°C and a processing time of 70 min to minimize this loss. These findings can guide improvements in algal oil refining and help consumers understand why DHA is lost during processing.

         <title>MFG‐E8 in Microglial Regulation: A Review of Basic Research in the Central Nervous System</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Microglia are resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) that play important roles under both physiological and pathological conditions. Milk fat globule‐epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG‐E8) is a glycoprotein that regulates various microglial functions and has a crucial impact on CNS health and disease. MFG‐E8 promotes phagocytosis and anti‐inflammatory responses and inhibits oxidative stress in microglia, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects and reducing neuroinflammation in diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, it promotes neural regeneration by stimulating the neurogenesis of neural progenitor cells and enhancing tissue repair. However, MFG‐E8 may also regulate microglia to exert pro‐tumor effects, facilitating CNS tumor invasion and making it a potential therapeutic target. This review focuses on targeting MFG‐E8 to regulate microglial function and provides a basis for identifying therapeutic targets for CNS diseases in the future.

         <title>Antioxidant and Anti‐Fatigue Properties of Cucumaria frondosa Abdominal Hydrolysates in an Endurance Swimming Mouse Model</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Cucumaria frondosa abdominal hydrolysates (CFHs) were prepared using flavorzyme under optimal conditions, and their antioxidant activity, stability, and anti‐fatigue activity were systematically evaluated. CFHs exhibited excellent free radical scavenging ability at temperatures below 60°C and under neutral to weakly acidic conditions. Under optimal conditions, the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of CFHs reached as high as 81.48%, with reducing activity up to 76.35% and Fe2+‐chelating activity of 46.36%. In our study on anti‐fatigue in mice, we utilized male ICR mice as experimental subjects and ginseng as the positive control. Forced swimming model experiments were conducted to assess the anti‐fatigue effects of CFHs, which were measured through swimming duration, hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of liver tissues, and various assay kits. Compared to the control group, CFHs significantly prolonged the forced swimming time to 12.79 min, outperforming ginseng. In addition, CFHs improved the glycogen reserve and antioxidant system, as well as reduced the expression levels of lactic acid (LA), ammonia (NH3), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Liver glycogen and blood glucose contents were significantly elevated in all three groups of mice treated with CFHs via gavage for 30 days. Concurrently, CFHs upregulated superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH‐Px), alleviating muscle damage. These findings suggest that CFHs may alleviate fatigue through multiple targeted mechanisms, including energy optimization, oxidative stress reduction, and inhibition of metabolic waste.

         <title>A Comparative Study of the Sensory and Physicochemical Properties of Cow Milk and Plant‐Based Milk Alternatives</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
There has been an increase in the consumption of plant‐based milk alternatives (PBMA), though these often differ in sensory properties compared to cow milk. Some consumers specifically seek PBMA with sensory qualities that resemble cow milk; however, such products are not yet available on the market. This study compared the chemical composition, particle size, color, viscosity, physical stability, and volatile compounds of seven commercial milk types: almond, coconut, oat, rice, soy, plant‐hybrid (a blend of plant‐based ingredients), and cow milk. Sensory descriptive analysis was used to evaluate appearance, aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel across the samples.
All PBMA, except soy milk, had lower protein levels (&lt;2%) than cow milk (3.2%), as soy naturally contains more protein due to being a legume. PBMA generally had larger particle sizes than cow milk (D4.3 = 1.41 µm), with rice milk showing the highest (4.19 µm), leading to greater sedimentation and grittiness. Soy milk was linked to beany and astringent attributes, while almond and oat had nutty and cereal notes. Coconut and cow milk were most similar in whiteness (L* &gt; 75) and creamy texture, attributed to their higher fat content and lactones. Plant‐hybrid PBMA, despite lacking cereal ingredients, shared sensory similarities with oat and rice milk.
Volatile compound analysis identified benzaldehyde in almond milk, contributing to its characteristic almond‐like aroma. Coconut milk contained lactones, which are associated with sweet and creamy notes.
Blending complementary PBMA ingredients, such as coconut and soy milk, would effectively mimic cow milk by introducing dairy‐like aroma, creaminess, and improved stability.
Practical Application: There is a need to reformulate PBMA to improve their sensory quality and meet consumer expectations. By understanding how chemical and physical properties influence the overall sensory experience, manufacturers can make better ingredient choices and optimize production processes to produce more desirable products.

ABSTRACT
The functional properties of food are closely linked to its atomic, molecular, and microstructural characteristics. This study evaluates the potential of time‐domain nuclear magnetic resonance (TD‐NMR) relaxometry as a non‐destructive technique for profiling the internal microstructure of Soy‐based plant‐based meat analogs (PBMA) compared to Angus beef burgers. TD‐NMR results were supported by measurements of water content, water release, and morphological analysis using visual and confocal microscopy. Microscopy revealed clear structural differences: Soy‐PBMA burgers exhibited a gel‐like, porous matrix, while Angus beef burgers showed compact, fibrous bundles characteristic of natural muscle tissue. Moisture analysis indicated lower total water content in Soy burgers, while water release tests demonstrated higher water‐holding capacity in Angus burgers, suggesting stronger protein–water interactions. TD‐NMR relaxation data reflected these structural distinctions. T₁ recovery times were longer in Angus burgers, while T₂ relaxation times were shorter and more narrowly distributed, consistent with tightly packed myofibrillar proteins. In contrast, Soy‐PBMA burgers exhibited broader T₂ distributions, reflecting a looser, more porous plant‐protein matrix. One‐dimensional (1D) and two‐dimensional (2D) T₁–T₂ spectral fingerprinting further highlighted differences in proton relaxation behavior, particularly between the myofibrillar proteins of meat and the globular proteins of plant‐based formulations. These findings confirm TD‐NMR relaxometry as a rapid, reliable, and non‐destructive method for differentiating the internal structure of meat and plant‐based products. This approach offers valuable insights for product development, quality assurance, and the design of next‐generation plant‐based meat alternatives.

         <title>A New Insight Into the Structure‐Activity Relationship of Antifreeze Activity in Bovine Hide Collagen Peptides: Based on Molecular Weight Differences</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
This study investigates the structure‐activity relationship between molecular weights and antifreeze activity in collagen peptides derived from bovine hide collagen. The peptides were prepared using ultrasound‐assisted enzymatic hydrolysis technology, followed by ultrafiltration fractionation (unsized (US), &lt;1 kDa, 1–3 kDa, and &gt;3 kDa). The antifreeze activity and structural characteristics of collagen peptides with different molecular weights were determined. The results revealed that the &lt;1 kDa fraction demonstrated optimal hypothermic protective activity on catalase activity and exhibited the smallest contact angle, while the 1–3 kDa fraction showed the highest thermal hysteresis activity. Comparative analysis demonstrated that low molecular weight peptides (&lt;3 kDa) contained significantly higher proportions of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids (P &lt; 0.05), along with enhanced solubility and surface hydrophobicity compared to their high molecular weight counterparts (&gt;3 kDa). Notably, molecular weight reduction correlated with progressive collagen crystal structure fragmentation, accompanied by increased β‐turn and random coil content. These structural modifications facilitated the exposure of internal chromophores, elevated fluorescence intensity, and generated uniformly dispersed peptide particles. Through isolation and purification of low molecular weight fractions, six novel antifreeze peptides were identified. Molecular docking simulations revealed their binding mechanism to ice crystals via hydrogen bonds, with peptide AAGPPGTP exhibiting superior antifreeze potential through the formation of six hydrogen bonds with ice crystal molecules. These findings provide novel insights for the strategic development of cryoprotective agents using collagen‐derived peptides.


Practical Application
This study systematically investigated the effect of the molecular weight of collagen peptides on antifreeze performance and elucidated the structural basis underlying their functional variations. Finally, the molecular weight range of peptide segments that is more conducive to exerting the antifreeze effect was determined. Furthermore, the research provides a concise production process flow. Remarkably, six antifreeze peptide sequences with safety, reliability, and non‐cytotoxicity were characterized after screening, and their physical and chemical properties were determined. These breakthroughs significantly facilitate the industrial‐scale production of antifreeze peptides.

         <title>Azodicarbonamide, Hydrogen Peroxide, and l‐Ascorbic Acid Aid in the Modification of Protein Texture During High‐Moisture Meat Analog Extrusion Processing</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
Protein texturization during high‐moisture extrusion is a complex process. Functional additives, like azodicarbonamide (ADA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and l‐ascorbic acid (AA), play a critical role in modulating protein structure and texture during food processing applications. However, the specific effects of these additives on protein texture, microstructure, and functionality during high‐moisture meat analog (HMMA) extrusion remain underexplored. This study aimed to understand how these additives at different concentrations (0.1%–2.0%) influence the texturization of wheat protein isolate (WPI) during extrusion at 45% and 60% moisture levels. WPI was selected due to its well‐known reactivity and fibrous texturization capability. The extrudates were analyzed for their texture, microstructure, and physicochemical characteristics. Amino acid composition was determined using ninhydrin‐based ion‐exchange chromatography. At low concentrations, ADA, H2O2, and AA improved cross‐linking and aggregation within the protein matrix, increasing hardness, chewiness, and cutting force. However, higher concentrations disrupted the protein network, yielding more porous and fragmented structures, evident from the observed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) micrographs. Color (L*, a*, b*) shifted significantly with increasing additive concentration, with ADA resulting in brighter and yellower samples, whereas AA and H2O2 had moderate effects. Amino acids mostly remained unchanged, but key residues, such as proline and lysine content, were slightly modified and correlated with the observed textural modifications. This study investigated how thermally reactive and oxidative additives influence protein cross‐linking and aggregation during extrusion, and how these molecular‐level changes govern fibrous texture formation in plant‐based meat analogs. Potential ADA and H2O2 residues post‐extrusion underscore the need for future safety‐focused quantification.

         <title>Developing Protein‐Enriched Wholegrain Bread With Different Plant Protein Isolates</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Bread is a widely consumed staple food across the world; however, it often lacks a complete amino acid profile. This study aims to determine the suitability of commercially available plant protein isolates for the development of protein‐enriched wholewheat bread, while preserving desired quality characteristics. Three protein isolates, soy protein isolate (SPI), pea protein isolate 1 (PPI1), and pea protein isolate 2 (PPI2), were assessed for their structural and functional properties, then incorporated in wholegrain bread formulations at 5%, 10%, and 15%, followed by assessment of dough properties and end‐use baking quality. The protein content of the isolates ranged from 80% to 90%, with PPI2 having the highest protein concentration. SPI had the highest denaturation temperature at 85.54°C ± 0.31°C and exhibited superior foam and emulsion stability at 81.94% and 94.21%, respectively. PPI1 had the highest solubility at 20.85%, whereas PPI2 had the highest surface hydrophobicity value at 152,645. Additionally, SPI formed the strongest gels with the lowest minimum gelation concentration of 12%. Increasing the protein concentration in the bread formulations resulted in a decrease in firmness, loaf volume, and specific volume. Breads with the 5% SPI had the highest loaf volume of 342 ± 7.6 mL, favorable textural properties, and L* values of 39.40 ± 2.13 for the crust and 45.83 ± 1.57 for the crumb, making it the more suitable protein isolate for protein‐enriched bakery applications. The addition of plant‐based proteins presents a viable solution for addressing the increasing consumer demand for both nutritious and sustainable food options.

         <title>Enhancement of Antioxidant Capacity and Phenolic Composition in Pine Pollen by Using Macro‐Fungi Fermentation</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
Fermentation is an effective method to enhance the bioactivity and bioavailability of bioactive compounds in plant foods. In this study, the effects of fermentations with Wolfiporia cocos, Morchella sp., and Ganoderma lingzhi on the total phenolics, total flavonoids, monomeric phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activities of fermented pine pollen were investigated. The results showed that the total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity 1,1‐diphenyl‐2‐picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity, 2,2′‐azinobis (3‐ethylbenzothiazoline‐6‐sulfonic acid) (ABTS) cation radical scavenging activity, and ferric‐ion‐reducing abilities of fermented pine pollen were increased by 154.38%, 182.43%, 90.81%, and 38.75%, respectively, compared with original pine pollen. Among the three fermentations, Morchella sp. provided the highest total phenolic content (793.70 µg/g) which was mainly responsible for the increased antioxidant capacity after each fermentation. Protocatechuic acid and 4‐coumaroylquinic acid were found to potentially contribute significantly to the antioxidant capacity. The results of this study demonstrated that the macro‐fungal fermentation effectively improved the bioactive components and antioxidant activity of pine pollen. It could provide the potential application of pine pollen in functional foods and nutraceutical products.


Practical Application
This research shows that fermentation of pine pollen with edible fungi boosts its antioxidant content and capacity. The fermented pine pollen could be a promising natural ingredient for functional foods like energy bars, beverages, or dietary supplements. It helps food manufacturers create food products for health‐conscious consumers seeking natural and highly bioavailable antioxidants. It also offers a practical way to improve the nutritional value of pine pollen‐based food products.

         <title>The Rise of Green Solvents: Application and Efficiency of Deep Eutectic Solvents in the Extraction of Flavonoids</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) provide a sustainable and effective way to extract flavonoids from herbal medicines, which are known for their notable antioxidant effects. Traditional extraction approaches are often costly and utilize harmful solvents. This review summarizes the fundamental concepts, preparation methods, and key factors that affect the safe and effective use of DESs for extracting flavonoids. The adaptability of DESs enables their integration with other green extraction technologies, such as ultrasound‐ and microwave‐assisted extractions, thereby enhancing their extraction efficiency. The extraction mechanism of flavonoids by DESs mainly includes the hydrogen bonding interactions between the DESs and flavonoids. This adaptability also highlights the potential of DESs for the eco‐friendly extraction of flavonoids. Current research shows that DESs may significantly contribute to the sustainable sourcing of flavonoids, representing a major advancement in the extraction and purification of flavonoids. Several future research directions about the extraction of flavonoids using DESs were also proposed, such as scaling up industrial processes, developing sustainable formulations of DESs, and integrating with other extraction techniques. The review points out those DESs are a practical and environmentally friendly choice for natural extraction methods, greatly supporting sustainable practices in flavonoids extraction.

         <title>Increasing the Oxidation Stability and Shelf‐Life Quality of Hazelnuts Using a New Peeling Technique</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

ABSTRACT
Hazelnuts without skin are preferred by consumers. Traditionally, the skin is peeled off by the roasting technique (RT). However, RT causes undesirable reactions such as lipid oxidation. Therefore, pressurized water technique (PWT) was developed as an alternative hazelnut peeling method. In this study, the effect of PWT on quality parameters including chemical composition, ultrastructure, peroxide value (PV), free fatty acidity (FFA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total phenolic content (TPC), total aflatoxin content (AFC), and volatile compounds of hazelnut samples during long‐term storage (12 months) was evaluated and compared with RT. Generally, FFA, TAC, AFC, and fatty acid contents in hazelnuts were not affected by peeling methods. Before storage, hazelnuts peeled by PWT exhibited slightly higher TPC and slightly lower protein and oil contents than hazelnuts peeled by RT. Additionally, no peroxide formation was detected in hazelnuts peeled by PWT before storage. Nevertheless, after storage, hazelnuts peeled by RT showed 8.2 times higher PV compared to hazelnuts peeled by PWT. Unlike hazelnuts peeled by PWT before storage, a total of 17 different volatile compounds, mostly lipid oxidation products, were detected in hazelnuts peeled by RT. Hexanal, an indicator for secondary oxidation, in hazelnuts peeled by RT before storage was determined to be 1.9 times higher than hazelnuts peeled by PWT. More burst oleosomes in microstructure of hazelnuts peeled by RT were observed by SEM. These results indicate that PWT demonstrated more oxidation stability and shelf‐life quality in hazelnuts compared to RT. Therefore, among these peeling methods, PWT can be recommended for safe food production.


Practical Application
While the roasting process is used to peel the hazelnut skin, lipid oxidation formation is inevitable during this process. Lipid oxidation products not only deteriorate the product quality but also pose a health risk. The newly developed, pressurized water peeling technique increases the lipid oxidation stability in hazelnuts. Increasing oxidation stability by the pressurized water peeling technique ensures that the quality of the hazelnut is preserved, and its shelf life is increased.

         <title>Robust Crayfish Size Estimation Under Complex Poses: A Hybrid YOLO‐LSTM Framework With Eye Distance Regression</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Accurate crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) size estimation under complex poses (e.g., curled bodies or occlusions) remains challenging for aquaculture automation. This study presents a Robust Crayfish Size Estimation (RCSE) framework that innovatively combines YOLO‐based detection with LSTM regression, which introduces eye distance as a novel pose‐invariant biometric feature. The two‐stage system employs a YOLOv11‐checkpoint for primary eye detection (98.2% precision), with automatic activation of the CBAM‐enhanced YOLOv11‐CBAM‐checkpoint (98.99% mAP50) upon detecting eye‐count anomalies, positional deviations, or bounding box conflicts—critical for handling complex pose scenarios. The YOLOv11n‐seg model achieves 99.50% mAP50 in body segmentation, while our LSTM network fuses eye distance with supplementary features (pincer length, head dimensions) to attain R2 = 0.897 in size estimation—a 23.6% improvement over traditional methods. This work establishes a new vision‐based paradigm for crustacean biometrics, demonstrating exceptional robustness to morphological variations and directly applicable to automated grading systems in precision aquaculture.

         <title>Development and Characterization of Synbiotic Microbeads for Enhanced Viability of Probiotics for Food Applications</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
In this study, a novel combination of biopolymers, that is, sodium alginate (Na‐Alg), whey protein isolates (WPI) combined with prebiotic fructo‐oligosaccharide (FOS) were used to encapsulate Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG via extrusion method. The obtained synbiotic microbeads were characterized for diameter and encapsulating efficiency. Morphological and molecular characterizations was done using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), x‐ray diffraction, and thermal stability by Thermogravimetric analysis. In addition, viability of encapsulated probiotic under in vitro simulated gastrointestinal conditions were evaluated. The results indicated that the prepared beads had a diameter of 1.13 mm on average and encapsulation efficiency of 93%. According to SEM micrographs, probiotics were successfully loaded in the microbeads. The FTIR spectra revealed strong bonding between the encapsulating materials indicating stable matrix formulation. Viability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions was significantly enhanced. Na‐Alg, WPI, and FOS composite microbeads have the potential to enhance stability as well as viability of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The results indicate that this novel synbiotic encapsulation can be useful for the application of probiotics in food products and food systems. Enhanced viability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions shows that this encapsulating matrix can be used for better probiotic delivery. The Na‐Alg/WPI/FOS matrix significantly enhanced probiotic survival, indicating its potential for improved probiotic delivery via food systems.

         <title>Functional Carbohydrates as Innovative Food Ingredients in Diabetes Management: A Succinct Review</title>
         <description>Journal of Food Science, Volume 90, Issue 7, July 2025. </description>

ABSTRACT
The current upsurge in the incidence of type‐2 diabetes as an essentially worldwide public health crisis can be attributed to increasing urbanization, environmental changes, and a shift in employment from heavy to sedentary work with increased automobile use, computerization, and mechanization. To curb the menace and mitigate the prevalence of diabetes, glucose regulation is essential, as high blood sugar levels raise susceptibility to developing type‐2 diabetes and its attendant consequences, including cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, neuropathy, angiopathy, and other conditions. Functional carbohydrate intake represents one of the best dietary strategies employed in the management of type‐2 diabetes mellitus because it is an affordable, food‐sourced, and effective approach that is currently generating research interest. While the efficacy of functional carbohydrates, including dietary fibers, in managing diseases is well established, there remains a significant gap in knowledge regarding their roles in regulating blood sugar and diabetes, as well as the underlying mechanisms of their actions. Therefore, this study aims to explore the role of functional carbohydrates as potential food ingredients in diabetes management. This study comprises a systematic review of pertinent articles published from 2017 to 2024, utilizing two primary online databases, namely, Google Scholar and the PubMed database, alongside additional resources such as ScienceDirect. The findings of this study indicate that functional carbohydrates serve as highly effective food ingredients for managing and regulating blood glucose via various mechanisms, including glycemic control, improved insulin secretion and sensitivity, modification of the gut microbiota, weight management, and enhanced lipid metabolism.
