         <title>Effect of the Consumption of Lean Red Meat from Beef (Pirenaica Breed) Versus Lean White Meat (Chicken) on the Gut Microbiota: A Randomized Cross‐Over Study in Healthy Young Adults</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A randomized crossover trial in healthy young adults (n = 16) compared the effects of lean red meat from beef (Pirenaica breed) and lean white meat from chicken on the gut microbiota composition and function. Both meat diets caused modest changes in microbial diversity and composition, suggesting comparable impacts when consumed as part of a habitual diet.








ABSTRACT
Limited evidence exists regarding the impact of meat consumption on the human gut microbiota, with factors such as animal source, production system, and cooking methods often overlooked. This study evaluates the effect of Pirenaica breed beef or conventional chicken‐based diets on the gut microbiota of healthy adults. A randomized cross‐over controlled trial with two 8‐week periods, separated by a 5‐week washout, is carried out. Participants consume either Pirenaica breed beef or chicken three times per week with their diet. Stool samples are collected at the beginning and end of each period. Gut microbiota is analyzed via amplification and sequencing of V3–V4 regions of 16S rRNA. Alpha diversity and relative abundances at phylum and genus levels are calculated. Sixteen participants are included (mean age 20.12 ± 2.36 years). Both diets induce modest changes in microbial composition, with no significant differences between groups. At the phylum level, Bacillota increased, while Synergistota, Chloroflexota, and Pseudomonadota decreased. Alpha diversity parameters declined significantly after the chicken‐based diet, although overall reduction in microbial diversity was observed across both interventions. The consumption of lean red meat or lean white meat as part of habitual diet produces similar effects on the gut microbiota.

         <title>Stevioside Improves Liver Insulin Resistance in Prediabetic Mice via IRS1/PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stevioside could improve the liver insulin resistance in prediabetic mice by regulating the IRS1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, indicating stevioside as a potential dietary approach to preventing prediabetes progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus.








ABSTRACT
Prediabetes progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can be effectively prevented by adequate dietary intervention via improved liver insulin resistance. Stevioside, as a natural and safe sweetener, has been shown to have antidiabetic properties. However, whether stevioside can enhance liver insulin resistance in prediabetes remains unclear. We therefore aimed to investigate the effect and molecular mechanisms of stevioside on liver insulin resistance in prediabetes. Prediabetic mice were induced using a high‐fat diet and treated with stevioside for 8 weeks. The effects of stevioside on gene expression levels and signaling pathways in the mice liver were investigated by RNA‐seq and gene enrichment analysis. We also treated the palmitic acid‐induced insulin‐resistance AML‐12 cells with stevioside,  and measured glucose uptake in insulin‐stimulated cells with 2‐NBDG. The expression levels of genes and proteins related to the insulin signaling pathway were detected using qRT‐PCR and Western blotting. Stevioside improved glucose tolerance and plasma insulin levels in prediabetic mice with insulin resistance and enhanced liver function. Stevioside could improve liver insulin resistance via IRS1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in prediabetic mice. Similarly, stevioside decreased the level of p‐IRS1 and increased the levels of p‐PI3K p85α, AKT, and p‐AKT in AML‐12 cells. Stevioside could improve glucose tolerance in prediabetic mice with insulin resistance, and ameliorate liver insulin resistance by regulating the IRS1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. These results may support stevioside as a potential dietary approach for preventing prediabetes progression to T2DM.

         <title>Postprandial Metabolism, Inflammation, and Plasma Bile Acid Kinetics in a Rat Model: Implications for Translational Research</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sprague‐Dawley rats were used to investigate postprandial metabolic and inflammatory responses following the consumption of an energy‐dense meal. Time‐resolved plasma and liver analyses revealed fluctuations in bile acid levels, particularly cholic acid, along with changes in metabolic intermediates, oxylipins, and inflammatory markers. This study offers novel insights into diet‐induced physiological adaptations in a murine model and underscores the importance of understanding these responses for effectively translating preclinical findings.








ABSTRACT
The postprandial period is an opportunity window to assess metabolic phenotype, and its study is gaining popularity due to the wealth of information that can be uncovered when a dietary challenge is associated with the application of metabolomics approaches. Bile acids (BA) were recently identified as signaling molecules that display major changes in circulating levels following food intake. In this regard, a gap of information remains linking BA postprandial kinetics with their possible metabolic effects. This study aimed to characterizing a murine model for investigating postprandial metabolism and inflammation. Changes in plasma and hepatic markers of metabolism, inflammation and BA levels were assessed in male Sprague‐Dawley rats before and after the ingestion of an energy‐dense meal. Rats display postprandial alterations in circulating BA levels, with cholic acid constituting the predominant species (36%). These changes are accompanied by shifts in intermediates of energy metabolism and inflammatory markers, as demonstrated by a four‐fold increase in hepatic NF‐κB protein content, a key inflammatory transcription factor, two hours after food intake. Despite inherent species‐specific differences, this murine model represents a promising tool for studying postprandial modulation energy metabolism, establishing a pioneering framework for future investigations into the role of BA in postprandial metabolic responses.

         <title>Folate‐Associated DNA Methylation and Chemotherapy‐Induced Toxicities in Patients With Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, Volume 69, Issue 14, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over half of patients with colorectal cancer experience severe chemotherapy‐induced side effects. The B‐vitamin folate may play a role in these side effects, potentially by altering DNA methylation, a mechanism of gene regulation. Our comprehensive literature search identified studies investigating DNA methylation associated with folate status/intake or with side effects and observed overlapping DNA methylation patterns. This study provides preliminary evidence suggesting folate‐associated DNA methylation may be linked to chemotherapy‐induced side effects.








ABSTRACT
Patients with stage II‐III colorectal cancer (CRC) often receive fluoropyrimidine‐based chemotherapy, usually combined with other regimens, of which ∼50% experience severe chemotherapy‐induced toxicities. The B‐vitamin folate has been associated with toxicity risk, possibly through effects on DNA methylation. Here, we examined the potential role of folate‐associated DNA methylation in the context of chemotherapy‐induced toxicities. Systematic literature searches were conducted to identify studies investigating either DNA methylation profiles associated with folate status/intake or with toxicities. Overlapping CpG sites and genes across studies investigating associations for “folate‐DNA methylation” and “DNA methylation‐toxicities” were identified. The probability of overlap was tested using hypergeometric tests and Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analyses were performed. Six studies were included. A significant number of CpGs and genes overlapped with altered methylation in response to both folate and hand‐foot syndrome (HFS) or thrombocytopenia. Moreover, methylation of genes within the KEGG pathway “focal adhesion” was related to folate status/intake and occurrence of HFS, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. We identified some overlapping DNA methylation profiles related to both folate exposures and toxicities. This provides preliminary evidence implying folate‐associated DNA methylation may determine risk of toxicities, and therefore may be considered a modifiable factor for improving patient outcomes.

         <title>Acetylcholinesterase Inhibition and Antioxidant Activity of DHA‐Disubstituted Phospholipids</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, Volume 69, Issue 14, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,2‐Di‐DHA‐PC phospholipids in nutraceutical form may cross the blood‐brain barrier and inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, with an efficacy similar to galantamine. This suggests their potential as neuroprotective agents in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.








ABSTRACT
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an essential fatty acid for the central nervous system. It plays a crucial role in brain health and the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in its phospholipid form, which has greater bioavailability. Previous studies, conducted by our group, enabled the enzymatic synthesis of pure disubstituted DHA phospholipids (1,2‐Di‐DHA‐PC). In the present study, the inhibitory activities of 1,2‐Di‐DHA‐PC on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and its antioxidant capacity were evaluated. The results showed that 1,2‐Di‐DHA‐PC exhibited significant inhibition of the AChE enzyme. Moreover, 1,2‐Di‐DHA‐PC showed antioxidant capacity compared to ascorbic acid, a natural antioxidant par excellence. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of 1,2‐Di‐DHA‐PC in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and its ability to offer protection against the lipid peroxidation of the neuronal aging process, one of the main drivers of neurodegeneration, suggesting the need for further studies to confirm its clinical applicability.

         <title>Maternal β‐Nicotinamide Mononucleotide Supplementation Reduces the IUGR Rate by Improving Mitochondrial Function in the Placenta of Sows via AMPK/PGC‐1α Pathway</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, Volume 69, Issue 14, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using late‐gestation sows as large animal models, this study demonstrates that β‐nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation remarkably lowers the ratio of intrauterine growth restriction and the concentrations of serum low‐density‐lipoprotein/lactate dehydrogenase. These NMN beneficial actions are highly linked with improvements of placental mitochondrial function, antioxidant capacity, lipid metabolism and apoptosis.








ABSTRACT
Metabolic disturbances in late gestation contributes to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the placenta, leading to intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), all of which are associated with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels. This study aimed to investigate the effects of maternal supplementation of β‐nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a nutraceutical NAD+ precursor, on IUGR rate and its underlying mechanisms. A total of 24 sows were randomly divided into either the control or NMN group, with each sow in the NMN group receiving 0.2 g of NMN per day. The results demonstrated that NMN supplementation significantly reduced the IUGR rate and increased NAD+ levels in the placenta of sows. Furthermore, NMN supplements upregulated mRNA and protein expressions of key mitochondrial regulators, such as PGC‐1α, declined oxidative stress and apoptosis, and improved lipid metabolism in the placenta. These effects were linked to the upregulation of p‐AMPK and the downregulation expression of p‐mTOR. Taken together, this study indicates that maternal NMN supplementation reduces the IUGR rate by improving mitochondria function, enhancing lipid metabolism, and declining oxidative stress in the placenta.

         <title>Effects of a Functional Food Mixture on Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis: Preliminary Results Highlighting the Modulation of Uremic Toxins Derived From Microbiota and Antioxidant Markers</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, Volume 69, Issue 14, July 2025. </description>

Combining functional foods such as turmeric and propolis extracts can be an excellent strategy for improving the antioxidant capacity of patients undergoing hemodialysis.








ABSTRACT
Combining functional foods may mitigate oxidative stress and gut dysbiosis complications in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study evaluated the impact of a mixture of turmeric and propolis on redox balance markers and microbiota‐derived uremic toxins in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Patients received 10 mL of a compound containing Curcuma longa L. (130 mg curcuminoids/day) and green propolis extract (110 mg/day of green propolis [EPP‐AF]), along with ginger and lemon juice, or a placebo, once a day for 8 weeks. Antioxidant capacity was analyzed using the oxygen radical absorption capacity (ORAC) test, iron reduction power (FRAP) test, and the 2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test. Malondialdehyde (MDA) was determined to estimate lipid peroxidation, and HPLC was used to evaluate uremic toxins. The study involved 35 patients: 17 in the intervention group (51 [19] years; body mass index [BMI], 23.7 [5.4] kg/m2) and 18 in the placebo group (51.5 [12.2] years; BMI, 23.4 [3.8] kg/m2). The intervention with functional foods significantly increased the FRAP test levels compared to the placebo group (p &lt; 0.01), and there was a tendency to reduce indole‐3‐acetic acid plasma levels. Combining functional foods such as turmeric and propolis extracts can improve CKD patients’ antioxidant capacity.

         <title>Neuroprotective Effect of Abscisic Acid on MPTP‐Induced Parkinson's Disease in Mice</title>

The neuroprotective mechanism of ABA against MPTP‐induced Parkinson's disease in mice. Acting on the cell membrane, ABA activates the LANCL2‐CREB signaling pathway, regulating cellular responses with anti‐inflammatory potential, and influences the PPARγ‐PGC‐1α axis important for cellular metabolism and anti‐inflammation. These two pathways converge to modulate intracellular inflammation. By reducing inflammation, ABA exerts its neuroprotective effect, alleviating the progression of MPTP‐induced Parkinson's disease symptoms, and demonstrating its neuroprotective potential.








ABSTRACT
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second largest neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease (AD), and neuroinflammation is one of its important causes. So far, there is no clear evidence that drugs can improve the onset of PD, so it is crucial to find and develop effective drugs for PD treatment. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone with structural and medicinal functions similar to the PPAR‐γ agonist thiazolidinedione drugs (TZDs). It has played therapeutic effects in a variety of inflammatory diseases, but the role and mechanism of PD have not been defined. The present study aimed to gain insight into the neuroprotection effects and mechanism of ABA in MPTP (1‐methyl‐4‐phenyl‐1,2,3,6‐tetrahydropyridine)‐induced PD models. In this study, we observed that in addition to significant behavioral abnormalities in MPTP‐induced mice, Inflammatory parameters such as ion calcium‐binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA‐1), glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF‐α), interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β), and interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) were also significantly increased in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). ABA treatment restored behavioral abnormalities and significantly reduced these inflammatory parameters in MPTP‐induced mice. Interestingly, these effects were not related to the activation of the lanthionine synthetase C‐like protein 2 (LANCL2) but were related to the regulation of the peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma (PPAR‐γ). Intraperitoneal injection of ABA ameliorated the MPTP‐induced increase in PPAR‐γ and peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor co‐activator‐1α (PGC‐1α) expression. Our findings suggest that intraperitoneal injection of ABA is neuroprotective against neurodegeneration induced by MPTP, and this effect is associated with the downregulation of neuroinflammation and modulation of the expression of PPAR‐γ and PGC‐1α. These results suggest that ABA is expected to develop as a therapeutic candidate for PD.

         <title>Shielding Human Adipocytes From Inflammation: The Protective Potential of Polyphenol‐Rich Opuntia ficus‐indica Cladode Extract</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, Volume 69, Issue 14, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inflammation of the adipose tissue contributes to metabolic disorders. OFI‐CE regulates the expression of proinflammatory genes in human hypertrophic fat cells. OFI‐CE is a promising candidate for use as a dietary supplement or therapeutic agent in nutritional interventions targeting inflammatory markers associated with obesity. DW, dry weight; IL, interleukin; OFI‐CE, Opuntia ficus‐indica cladode extracts; ORAC, oxygen radical absorbance capacity; TAEC, trolox‐equivalent antioxidant capacity; TNF‐α, tumor necrosis factor‐α; TPC, total phenol content.








ABSTRACT
Opuntia ficus‐indica (OFI) has attracted much attention as a source of antioxidant and antiinflammatory compounds. We hypothesize that the antioxidant content of OFI cladode extract may improve adipocyte dysfunction resulting from inflammatory stimulation of hypertrophic adipocytes. To this end, the properties of OFI cladode hydroalcoholic extract were evaluated in terms of antioxidant activity, regulation of adipocyte inflammation, and adipocyte/monocyte interaction in human adipocytes rendered dysfunctional by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α). The major phenolic compounds identified were isorhamnetin derivatives and phenolic acids, including piscidic and eucomic acids. Our results show that OFI cladode extract exhibits antiradical activities and reduces the adhesion and transmigration activity of monocytes to inflamed adipocytes by inhibiting various cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules such as interleukin (IL)‐6 and IL‐8 by ∼80%, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)‐1, C‐X‐C motif chemokine ligand (CXC‐L)10, macrophage colony‐stimulating factor (M‐CSF) from 40% to 50%, and intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 (ICAM‐1) by 70% at the higher concentration. In structurally and mechanistically by protein–ligand docking profiling study, piscidic acid proved to be the best potential candidate for a regulatory interaction with the activities of nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2 (NRF‐2) and nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB). In summary, these data highlight the potential of OFI as a dietary supplement in nutritional treatments aimed at combating the inflammatory stigmata of obesity.

         <title>Plasma Trimethylamine N‐Oxide Levels in Nondialysis Chronic Kidney Disease Patients Following Meal Challenge</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, Volume 69, Issue 14, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This pilot study assessed the short‐term effects of codfish, red meat, and chickpeas on plasma trimethylamine N‐oxide (TMAO) levels in nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Codfish caused a temporary increase in TMAO levels in these patients.








ABSTRACT
Trimethylamine N‐oxide (TMAO) is a uremic toxin accumulated in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and involved with atherosclerosis. TMAO is derived from the gut microbiota (nutrient fermentation) and is found in some fish and seafood. This pilot study evaluated the acute effects of cod fish, red meat, and vegetable meal consumption on plasma TMAO levels in nondialysis CKD patients. Patients (five women, three men, 72.5 [7.7] years, body mass index [BMI], 25.6 [1.4] kg/m2, glomerular filtration rate, 32.5 [18.5] mL/min) consumed lunches containing codfish, red meat, and chickpeas, within a 7‐day interval between meals. TMAO plasma levels were assessed using the HPLC‐EM/EM method before and after the 4‐h meal challenge. Patients presented TMAO plasma levels of 9.06 µM. Consumption of codfish significantly increases the TMAO levels (to 23.5 µM, p &lt; 0.001) compared to red meat and chickpeas. We conclude that codfish, compared to red meat and vegetable meal, provoked a transient elevation in TMAO levels in patients with CKD. Therefore, this result suggests that it is prudent to prescribe fish with low TMAO content for these patients. The response to ingesting TMAO‐rich foods in CKD patients needs more study.

         <title>Comparison of Different Methods of Constructing a Celiac Disease Model in BALB/c Mice</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, Volume 69, Issue 14, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and stable animal models of celiac disease (CD) are crucial for CD research, dietary supplement research, and new drug development. This study aimed to establish CD models by administering gliadin to parental mice and first‐generation mice on gluten‐free diets using two ways: intraperitoneal injection and a combination of sensitization of intraperitoneal injection and gavage. Various indicators, including clinical manifestations, characteristic indicators of CD, inflammatory factors, intestinal barriers, immune cells, and other related indicators, were used to compare different modeling methods. The results showed that all four methods could induce varying degrees of CD symptoms in mice. Additionally, intraperitoneal injection of gliadin was more effective than the combination sensitization, and first‐generation mice on gluten‐free diets exhibited more significant CD symptoms compared to parental mice. The analysis revealed that intraperitoneal injection in first‐generation mice led to significant increases in specific IgG and total IgE antibody levels (p &lt; 0.01); a marked shortening of intestinal villus and crypt hyperplasia in the jejunum; significant increases in pro‐inflammatory factors IFN‐γ, TNF‐α, IL‐17, and IL‐15 (p &lt; 0.01); and a significant decrease in the anti‐inflammatory factor IL‐4 (p &lt; 0.01). Additionally, there was a severe imbalance of immune cells in the spleen and intestinal lymph nodes. These results suggest that the model of intraperitoneal injection in first‐generation mice was more efficient, stable, and significant in the construction. This study provides a theoretical basis for the efficient construction of CD models.








ABSTRACT
Efficient and stable animal models of celiac disease (CD) are crucial for CD research, dietary supplementation research, and new drug development. This study aimed to establish CD models by administering gliadin to parental and first‐generation mice on a gluten‐free diet using two intraperitoneal injection and a combination of sensitization by intraperitoneal injection and gavage. Various indicators, including clinical manifestations, characteristic indicators of CD, inflammatory factors, intestinal barriers, immune cells, and other related indicators, were used to compare different modeling methods. The results showed that all four methods induced varying degrees of CD symptoms in the mice. The analysis revealed that intraperitoneal injection in first‐generation mice significantly increased specific IgG and total IgE antibody levels; markedly shortened intestinal villus and crypt hyperplasia in the jejunum; significantly increased pro‐inflammatory cytokines IFN‐γ, IL‐17, IL‐15, and TNF‐α; and significantly decreased the anti‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐4. Additionally, immune cells in the spleen and intestinal lymph nodes were severely imbalanced. These results suggest that the intraperitoneal injection model in first‐generation mice is more efficient, stable, and significant. This study provides a theoretical basis for the efficient construction of CD models.

         <title>Alleviating Effect and Potential Mechanisms of Selenium Supplementation on Chronic Liver Injury Induced by Oxidized Soybean Oil</title>

Se supplementation mitigated OSO‐induced liver injury by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and fatty acid metabolism disorders. It reversed the imbalance of polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites and inhibited the PI3K‐AKT pathway, while potentially activating the Nrf2 pathway to improve overall liver health.








ABSTRACT

Lipid oxidation can induce liver oxidative stress and lipotoxic damage, while selenium (Se) possesses detoxification, antioxidation, immunity, and liver protection functions. However, the effects of Se and oxidized lipids on liver oxidative stress and lipid metabolism, along with the underlying mechanisms, remain underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of Se against liver injury induced by oxidized soybean oil (OSO) in mice. C57BL/6J mice (n = 60) were randomly divided into Control (0.2 mg/kg Se+7% fresh soybean oil), OSO (0.2 mg/kg Se+7% OSO), and OSO+Se (1.0 mg/kg Se+7% OSO) groups for 10 weeks. The results showed that Se supplementation mitigated the morphological structure and functional impairment, inflammation, and oxidative stress of the liver caused by OSO, and improved changes to the liver fatty acid profile and lipid metabolism disorders. It also reversed the OSO‐induced imbalance of liver polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites and inhibited OSO‐induced activation of the PI3K‐AKT pathway. Se may activate the Nrf2 pathway and inhibit the PI3K‐AKT pathway to improve inflammation, oxidative stress, and fatty acid metabolism disorders, thereby reducing liver injury. These findings highlight the nutritional relevance of Se as a potential therapeutic agent for preventing liver damage from oxidized lipids.

         <title>Comparative LC‐MS Proteomics of Quinoa Grains: Evaluation of Bioactivity and Health Benefits by Combining In Silico Techniques With In Vitro Assays on Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Cells</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, Volume 69, Issue 14, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Identifying health‐promoting molecules such as bioactive peptides in complex food mixtures is a major challenge. In this study, we investigated proteins and protein hydrolysates from four quinoa varieties to evaluate their potential anticancer effects on colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Using a multidisciplinary approach combining in vitro assays, LC‐MS proteomics, and data mining, we identified peptide sequences with possible proapoptotic activity. Data analysis revealed a correlation between these peptides and the expression of apoptosis biomarkers, helping to better understand their biological role and facilitating the search for bioactive compounds in complex natural sources.








ABSTRACT
In the present study, we investigated the potential biological effects of proteins and peptides extracted from four different commercial quinoa grain varieties: Black (B), Red (R), White (W), and Royal White (RO), using Caco‐2 cells as a proliferation model. Concentration–response curves were constructed to evaluate cytotoxicity and antiproliferative effects. Interestingly, peptides exhibited higher cytotoxicity than proteins, particularly in R and RO quinoa varieties. Based on these findings, we used a data mining approach to identify and compare the cytotoxic proteins in the four quinoa varieties. Using their relative abundance, we successfully classified R and RO quinoa as a cohesive group using classification models. To gain deeper insights into the biological effects on cells, we comprehensively analyzed the differential expression of apoptosis biomarkers using liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS) targeted proteomics. Finally, we correlated the apoptosis profile with the relative abundance of cytotoxic proteins. All these studies were supported by the application of multivariate data analysis. The results demonstrated the potential anticancer of quinoa grain proteins and peptides and provided the basis for more focused mechanistic studies aimed at developing functional foods and nutraceuticals.

         <title>Development of a Wine By‐Product‐Based Beverage and Study of Its Potential to Postprandial Glycemia Regulation in Healthy Individuals: A Proof of Concept Study</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, Volume 69, Issue 14, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The postprandial glycemia of healthy adults is not downregulated by the coadministration of a sugar solution and a wine by‐product enriched beverage due to the high variability in the response. Blood phenolic compounds of responders’ volunteers are not associated with the reduction effect of postprandial hyperglycemia.








ABSTRACT

Aligned with the principles of the circular bioeconomy, this study explores the use of winemaking by‐products as a source of bioactive phenolic compounds. Skins and seeds from Tempranillo and Graciano grapevine varieties were conditioned to prepare a phenolic‐rich beverage. To study its hypoglycemic properties, a pilot trial was conducted to evaluate postprandial glycemia after the intake of the wine by‐product‐based beverage (WBB). The postprandial glycemia of 10 healthy adults was measured after the intake of: (i) water + sugar solution, (ii) WBB + sugar solution, and (iii) WBB + water. In parallel to blood glucose measurement, blood samples were also collected using dried blood spot cards to determine the phenolic metabolites by UHPLC‐QqQ‐MS/MS. Although blood glucose levels tended to decrease after WBB intervention, these changes were not statistically significant related to the interindividual variability. The volunteers showing a reduction in blood glucose were classified as “responders”, and those who showed no changes were classified as “non‐responders”. Wine by‐products can be effectively used in functional beverages formulation to increase bioactive compound content and manage postprandial glucose in some individuals.

         <title>Exploration of Biomarkers of Food Intake in a Caribbean Hispanic Population</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Validated BFIs show significant associations with food intake in an observational setting, and those associations were often modulated by non‐dietary factors. The identification of genotype‐BFI associations implies that the utility of a BFI could depend on common genetic differences.








ABSTRACT
Valid measures of dietary intake are essential for health and nutrition research, but typical forms‐ or interview‐based measurements are susceptible to random and systematic errors. Although many biomarkers of food intake (BFIs) have been validated, we aimed to explore how food‐BFI relationships are affected by genetic and lifestyle factors among Caribbean Hispanic adults. Dietary, clinical, anthropometric, blood metabolomics, and genotype data from 782 Puerto Rican adults were available. Thirty‐one BFI‐food intake relationships were assessed using linear regression, including covariates based on significant covariate‐BFI associations (i.e., age, body weight, physical activity, and sex). We observed 12 known BFI‐food pairs that reached statistical significance, of which 11 remained significant after adjustment. Applying genome‐wide association tests of blood metabolites to BFI‐food pairs, genetic variants rs7078243 and rs62501664 were identified as modifying relationships with 3‐methylxanthine‐coffee and 3‐methylhistidine‐poultry, respectively. Eleven validated biomarker‐food intake pairs remained statistically significant after adjusting for covariates. Identification of genotype‐BFI associations accentuates that the implementation of certain BFIs will depend on common genetic differences.

         <title>Saucerneol Inhibits the Growth, Migration, and Invasion of Osteosarcoma Cells In Vitro and Prevents Metastasis‐Associated Osteolysis Ex Vivo</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saucerneol (Sauc) is a phytochemical compound classified as a lignan, derived from Saururus chinensis. The JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway is the primary target of Sauc in osteosarcoma cells. Sauc disrupts mitochondrial potential and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to apoptotic cell death. Sauc attenuates metastasis‐associated osteolysis in ex vivo bone organ cultures. Sauc may serve as promising a daily health supplement and phytomedicine.








ABSTRACT
Saururus chinensis has traditionally been used to treat various diseases. Biologically active compounds isolated from S. chinensis exhibit diverse pharmacological activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the antiosteosarcoma effects of saucerneol (Sauc), a lignan, purified from the aerial parts of S. chinensis using in vitro and ex vivo experimental models. Sauc was purified from the methanolic extract of S. chinensis. It exhibited toxicity against MG63 and SJSA‐1 cells (human osteosarcoma cell lines), inducing apoptotic morphological changes and suppressing cell migration. Sauc triggered PARP cleavage and decreased the expression of antiapoptotic proteins. It also disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Proteome profiling, western blotting, and immunocytochemistry revealed that Sauc inhibited the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Furthermore, Sauc downregulated the expression of metastasis‐associated proteins, suppressed invasion through extracellular matrix‐coated membranes, and inhibited anchorage‐independent cell growth. In an ex vivo bone organ culture, Sauc attenuated tumor‐induced osteolysis. This study demonstrated that Sauc exerts anti‐osteosarcoma effects by inducing apoptosis, inhibiting cell migration and invasion in vitro, and mitigating metastasis‐associated bone degradation ex vivo. Thus, Sauc holds promise as a protective compound in daily health supplements and a therapeutic agent against human osteosarcoma.

         <title>Ameliorative Potential of Synthetic Flavone‐Derivative in Diabetes‐Associated Neurodegeneration</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavone derivative (2‐(1,3‐benzodioxol‐5‐yl)‐4H‐chromen‐4‐one 5 (2BDC45)) is a derivative of Prosogerin A (phytoflavonoid). Study examined the sequential neuroprotective potential of the assigned compound by following the in silico and in vivo assessments with efficient methods and perspectives. Results revealed the in silico assessment up to molecular simulation of MM/PBSA and target gene expressions with histoarchitectures of cortex and hippocampus depicted the interferences of the compound through in vivo assessments.








ABSTRACT
The current study was carried out to explore the neuroprotective efficacy of the synthesized compound 2‐(1,3‐benzodioxol‐5‐yl)‐4H‐chromen‐4‐one 5 (2BDC45) in diabetes‐associated neurodegeneration through in silico and in vivo assessments. In silico exploration of molecular docking showed a significant binding energies of −8.5, −9.3, and −7.4 kcal/mol for 2BDC45 against the target enzymes, i.e., acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and DPP‐4, respectively. These findings were further confirmed through 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations, assessing parameters like RMSD, RMSF, SASA, MMPBSA, and PCA. Treatment with 2BDC45 exhibited the neuroprotective changes in the hippocampus and cortex regions of type 2 diabetes‐associated neurodegenerations. Consequently, histopathological analysis of these brain regions, supported by molecular biological analyses of key genes such as GLUT‐3, GSK, MAP, and PPARγ corroborated the neuroprotection. The lipid profile, HOMA, and antioxidants exhibited notable changes by the interference of the treatments. The treatments shown significant ameliorations in glucose metabolism by following the expressions of GLUT‐3 and GSK, while MAP kinase and PPARγ showed significant restorations in the cortex and hippocampus. In conclusion, it can be implied the test flavone derivative has the capacity to amplify neural plasticity by following the scavenging of free radicals, improved glucose metabolism, and targeted genes expression.

         <title>Folic Acid Reduces Insulin Resistance in Mice With Diet‐Induced Obesity by Altering One‐Carbon Metabolism and DNA Methylation Patterns of Hypothalamic and Hepatic Insulin Receptor Gene</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Folic acid (FA), a methyl donor in one‐carbon (1C) metabolism, is essential for gene methylation and expression and reported to reduce insulin resistance (IR). However, whether reduced IR is mediated by insulin receptor (InsR) gene methylation is unknown. FA supplemented to high‐fat diet fed mice reduced body weight, adiposity, IR, and altered 1C metabolism. This was associated with hepatic and hypothalamic InsR methylation and expression. This highlights the potential to leverage 1C metabolism to reduce obesity progression by gene methylation.








ABSTRACT

Diet‐induced obesity and insulin resistance (IR) are associated with alterations in one‐carbon (1C) metabolism, gene methylation, and expression. Folate, a methyl donor in 1C metabolism, is essential in gene methylation and expression and has been shown to reduce IR but the precise mechanism(s) remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated whether reduced IR can be explained by 1C metabolism modifications and differences in hypothalamic and hepatic IR‐related genes expression and methylation patterns. Four‐week‐old male C57BL/6J mice (n = 12/group) received high‐fat diets (HFDs) with 1‐ (control), 5‐ (5FA‐HFD), or 10‐fold (10FA‐HFD) AIN‐93G amounts folic acid (FA) for 15 weeks. Body weight, hepatic 1C metabolites, plasma insulin and glucose, and hepatic and hypothalamic expression and methylation of IR‐related genes were measured. 5FA‐HFD and 10FA‐HFD mice had ∼50% lower HOMA‐IR compared to control. 10FA‐HFD mice also had lower body weight (9%) and adiposity (13%) and higher s‐adenosylmethionine levels (19%). 5FA‐HFD mice had higher hepatic s‐adenosylhomocysteine levels (26%) and DNA methyltransferase 3b expression (45%). Methylation of the InsR gene was correlated with gene expression and the improved metabolic phenotype. FA supplementation reduced IR by modifying 1C metabolism in DIO male mice by differentially altering hypothalamic and hepatic methylation patterns of InsR gene.

         <title>Fatty Acids and Proteostasis in Skeletal Muscle Atrophy: Mechanistic Insights From In Vitro and Preclinical Findings</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Skeletal muscle atrophy is a morbid systemic condition. It could be the result of aging, muscle disuse, or a disease such as diabetes and cancer. In atrophying muscle, protein turnover is unbalanced with an amplified pro‐atrophy signaling resulting in a high‐rate protein degradation and a low‐rate protein synthesis. Fatty acids improve muscle condition by fine‐tuning a panoply of molecular processes to reestablish muscle protein homeostasis and reinforce muscle resilience against pro‐atrophy conditions. Fatty acids promote protein synthesis and lower their degradation in atrophying muscle which contributes to a balanced protein metabolism in muscle fiber. Embracing the health effects of fatty acids unveils a promising strategy to fortify muscles and uphold overall physical well‐being.2








ABSTRACT
Skeletal muscle atrophy is a threatening condition related to aging and other pathologies such as diabetes and cancer. Thus, the development of groundbreaking therapeutic strategies is mandatory for better management of skeletal muscle atrophy in the elderly and diseased individuals. Nutritional interventions have gained recognition as fundamental strategies for attenuating or preventing the advancement of skeletal muscle atrophy, with particular attention focused on fatty acids as potential therapeutic agents. This review synthesizes contemporary knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms through which isolated fatty acids (distinct from complex oils or mixtures) may exert beneficial effects against muscle atrophy focusing on proteostasis. The discussion begins with an overview of protein turnover regulation in skeletal muscle tissue, subsequently providing a comprehensive examination of the anti‐atrophic properties of fatty acids at the molecular level. While preclinical studies utilizing laboratory models have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of fatty acids in modulating muscle atrophy pathways, translation to clinical applications requires further investigation to establish mechanistic understanding and reproducible efficacy in human subjects.

         <title>Interleukin‐17A Exacerbates the Development of High‐Salt‐Induced Hypercholesterolemia</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high‐salt diet (HSD) was tested for its promotion effect on hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. We demonstrated that HSD activated inflammatory response via the IL‐17 signaling pathway, thereby promoting the elevation of circulating IL‐17, which activated the cholesterol biosynthesis through promoting SREBP2 transcription and nuclear translocation of the protein. This study fully confirms that IL‐17 is a comorbid factor of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia induced by an HSD.








ABSTRACT
This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms through which dietary salt affects blood pressure and cholesterol homeostasis. We established a hypertension and hypercholesterolemia model via feeding a high salt diet (8% NaCl, HSD) to Dahl salt‐sensitive (SS) rats for 5 weeks. This diet regime successfully induced hypertension and increased serum TC and LDL‐C. RNA‐seq and RT‐qPCR analyses confirmed that activation of cholesterol biosynthesis in liver tissues by an HSD led to elevated serum cholesterol levels. In vivo experiments suggested that the HSD‐induced elevation of serum IL‐17 likely contributes to hypertension and dyslipidemia as a co‐pathogenic factor. Knockdown or overexpression of IL‐17RA in HepG2 cells and HUVECs further confirmed that upregulating this signaling pathway promotes the nuclear entry of SREBP2, a protein critical to cholesterol biosynthesis. In HUVECs, IL‐17RA inhibition enhanced NO production, whereas IL‐17RA overexpression suppressed it. Administration of rat‐specific anti‐IL‐17A antibody significantly attenuated salt‐induced hypertension and reduced serum TC and LDL‐C levels. These findings demonstrate that a high‐salt diet elevates the risk of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia by activating IL‐17 signaling pathway. This suggests that IL‐17A inhibitors may serve as potential therapeutic agents for treating salt‐induced hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.

         <title>The Regulatory Effects of Pea Protein Hydrolysate on Lipid Metabolism in Gestational Diabetic Mice</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pea protein hydrolysate reduces serum triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) mice, while increasing high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels in the liver, improving hepatic lipid accumulation and glycogen synthesis. It reduces placental weight while promoting protective structures and activating abnormal inhibitory pathways, ultimately improving lipid metabolism and protecting placental development.









ABSTRACT
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) poses significant risks to maternal health and adverse metabolic outcomes in offspring. Pea protein hydrolysate (PPH), a kind of bioactive peptide with anti‐diabetic properties, was evaluated for its therapeutic potential in the GDM mouse model. While PPH exhibited mild glucose‐lowering effects, high‐dose PPH (1000 mg/kg/day) significantly ameliorated insulin resistance and systemic dyslipidemia, including reductions in serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hepatic lipid accumulation. In addition, the PPH treatment could significantly modulate the placental pathology. Thus, a mechanistic study was conducted from the view of placental lipid metabolism. It was found that the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/PPARγ signaling pathway was involved in the mechanisms of action of PPH, which successfully prevented excessive placental lipid accumulation and ensured that the key structures of the placenta remained in the original state. Furthermore, PPH alleviated the GDM‐induced reduction in placental phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) levels, restoring two functionally critical lipid species: PC (16:0/20:4) and FAHFA (26:1/22:3). Collectively, PPH showed the potential to mitigate GDM‐associated metabolic disturbances and placental dysfunction.

         <title>Collagen Peptides Ameliorate Murine Chronic Colitis: Toward the Molecular Basis for Their Enhancement of Intestinal Epithelial Defenses Against Oxidative Stress</title>

Collagen peptides ameliorate murine chronic colitis by enhancing intestinal epithelial antioxidant defenses.








ABSTRACT

Collagen peptides are a promising nutraceutical therapeutic for ulcerative colitis. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of collagen peptides in a murine model of chronic colitis and in human intestinal epithelial cells.


Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to three 10‐day cycles of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) (i.e., 4 days of DSS drinking and 6 days of recovery) to induce chronic colitis. Collagen peptides (150 and 300 mg/kg/day) derived from ginger protease‐degraded gelatin hydrolysate dose‐dependently improved clinical signs, colon histopathology, and biochemical markers of experimental chronic colitis. In Caco‐2 cells, collagen peptides and their typical in vivo degradation products (i.e., prolyl‐hydroxyproline, glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline) attenuated H2O2‐induced lactate dehydrogenase release, intracellular oxidant burst, and cell viability loss with those free amino acids showing significantly weaker activities. Collagen peptides and prolyl‐hydroxyproline, rather than glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline, activated cellular hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1 signaling that upregulated several heat‐shock proteins and antioxidant enzymes, whereas glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline boosted cellular glutathione production by directly or indirectly increasing substrate supply. Collagen peptides were protective against chronic colitis, and their anti‐colitis mechanism involves the enhancement of epithelial defenses against oxidative stress via hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1‐dependent/‐independent pathways.

         <title>Green Coffee Extract (Coffea canephora) Administered as Treatment Modulates Hepatic Markers and Attenuates Hepatic Steatosis in Rats Fed a High‐Fat Diet</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>

Green coffee extract was administered as treatment or prevention in rats fed a high‐fat diet. The green coffee extract as a treatment modulated hepatic markers and attenuated hepatic steatosis.








ABSTRACT
Green coffee is rich in bioactive compounds with antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties. This study evaluated the effect of green coffee extract (Coffea canephora), as treatment or prevention, on metabolic alterations and morphology of liver and adipose tissue pad in rats fed a high‐fat diet (HF). Forty‐eight male Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) were divided into four groups: normocaloric diet (CT), HF, high‐fat diet with green coffee extract as prevention (HFP), or as treatment (HFT). Two‐milliliter of green coffee extract per day per animal was added to the diet. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, inflammatory and oxidative markers analyses, and histological analyses of liver and adipose tissue were performed. The green coffee extract, as treatment or prevention, did not affect food intake, weight gain or oxidative and inflammatory profile of liver and adipose tissue, or adipose tissue pad morphology (p &gt; 0.05). However, the HFT group decreased the concentration of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased high‐density lipoprotein (HDL‐c), and reduced severity of hepatic steatosis verified by lower lipid accumulation in the liver (p &lt; 0.05). The green coffee extract as a treatment may benefit liver health in conditions of obesity, modulating hepatic markers and attenuating hepatic steatosis, suggesting its potential as an adjuvant in treating metabolic alterations.

         <title>Healthy Plant‐Based Diet Is Associated With a Reduced Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Large‐Scale Prospective Analysis</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a large‐scale cohort study, we found that healthy plant‐based diets are significantly associated with a lower risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and identified its potential anti‐inflammatory properties as well as its association with lipid metabolism.








ABSTRACT
Current studies indicated a potential inverse association between plant‐based diets (PBD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Large‐scale research is needed to confirm the protective role of PBD in IBD risk. This study evaluated the associations between PBD and IBD risk and explored potential mediators. This prospective cohort study included 143 434 UK Biobank participants, using 24‐h dietary recalls to calculate PBD indexes. Cox regression assessed associations between PBD and IBD risk. Decomposition and mediation analyses evaluated dietary components and serum biomarkers. During a mean follow‐up of 14.5 years, 1117 participants developed IBD (795 UC, 322 CD). Results showed inverse associations between hPDI and UC risk (0.92, 95% CI = 0.86–0.99) and CD risk (0.86, 95% CI = 0.77–0.96), and between PDI and CD risk (0.86, 95% CI = 0.77–0.96). A positive association was found between uPDI and CD risk (1.15, 95% CI = 1.02–1.29). Fruits and vegetables were identified as protective factors. Neutrophils, white blood cells, and CRP were major mediators of the associations between PBD and IBD risk. The healthy plant‐based diet is inversely associated with IBD risk and may be partly explained by the anti‐inflammatory properties of plant‐based foods.

         <title>Taxifolin Inhibits Platelet Activation and Thrombosis by Regulating the PI3K/Akt and MAPK Signaling Pathways</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we discovered that taxifolin modulates platelet‐related MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation, granule release, adhesion, spreading, and clot retraction. It also exerts beneficial antithrombotic effects without apparent side effects. This phytochemical presents novel insights for developing platelet‐related thrombotic disease therapies.








ABSTRACT
Excessive platelet activation plays a pivotal role in the development of cardiovascular disease. Taxifolin is a natural dihydroflavonol compound with antioxidant properties. However, its mechanism of action on platelets and thrombosis remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of taxifolin on platelet function and thrombus formation and identify its potential targets. The results revealed that taxifolin inhibited platelet aggregation induced by various agonists, such as ADP, collagen, thrombin, U46619, and convulxin. Moreover, it also limited platelet adhesion to collagen and the synthesis of TXA2. Additionally, it impeded platelet integrin αIIbβ3 ‘’outside‐in ‘’ signaling, which is crucial for stable clot formation. In animal models, taxifolin showed promising results in preventing pulmonary embolism and arterial thrombosis. More importantly, taxifolin did not cause significant side effects. Network pharmacology analysis suggested that taxifolin may exert its effects through key targets involved in platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, such as MAPK1, AKT1, SRC, PIK3R1, and MAPK8. Meanwhile, molecular docking studies confirmed the interaction between taxifolin and MAPK1. Furthermore, taxifolin inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK, p38, JNK, and Akt, key proteins in the MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Overall, taxifolin demonstrated potential as an antiplatelet and antithrombotic agent, acting through multiple pathways and targets.

         <title>Telomeres and Telomerase: Targets for Chemoprevention of Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Bioactive Food Compounds</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, Volume 69, Issue 13, July 2025. </description>

Telomerase maintains telomere length and is essential in aging, senescence, and cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), telomerase reactivation helps suppress chromosomal instability in cirrhosis, while its inhibition in dysplastic nodules may prevent cancer progression. Mutations in the TERT promoter are frequent in tumors. Bioactive food compounds (BFCs) may modulate telomerase, reducing HCC incidence or delaying its onset.








ABSTRACT
The maintenance of telomere length by telomerase plays an essential role in senescence, aging, and cancer. Mutations in the TERT promoter, a telomerase subunit, are frequent in human cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), telomere shortening contributes to preneoplastic conditions such as cirrhosis. Telomerase activation during cirrhosis may reduce chromosomal instability, while its suppression in early dysplastic nodules may prevent hepatocarcinogenesis. Evidence suggests that bioactive food compounds (BFCs) can reduce the incidence and/or delay the onset of HCC by modulating telomerase activity. A systematic review was conducted on the role of BFCs in telomerase activity during hepatocarcinogenesis. BFCs were analyzed in isolated form or as part of extracts and categorized into fatty acids, isoprenoids, isothiocyanates, and phenolic compounds. Despite structural diversity, BFCs modulate telomerase through common mechanisms, including inhibition of activating proteins at the TERT promoter, activation of nuclear receptors, or histone H3 hyperacetylation. Indirectly, telomerase can also be modulated via activation of antioxidant defense pathways. Understanding telomerase reactivation and its modulation by BFCs is key to establishing effective HCC chemoprevention strategies targeting telomerase.

Soybean bioactive compounds, including isoflavones, flavonoids, and soyasaponins, modulate key pathways involved in lung cancer, such as MAPK, ER, and NF‐κB.








ABSTRACT
Soybean (Glycine max) is one of Asia's most valuable oil crops, offering a rich source of dietary protein and bioactive compounds with diverse clinical applications. Key bioactive phytochemicals in soybean, including isoflavones, flavonoids, carotenoids, phytosterols, soyasaponins, fatty acids, and protein isolates, are known for their potential health benefits. These compounds exert functional properties by modulating critical metabolic pathways, such as the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK), estrogen receptor (ER), and nuclear factor kappa‐B (NF‐κB) pathways. With a growing body of epidemiological and clinical evidence supporting the anticancer potential of soybean, this review systematically examines the role of soybean‐derived bioactive components in the prevention and treatment of lung cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first review to focus specifically on the impact of soy‐derived bioactive components on lung cancer progression and modulation, offering insights into their mechanisms and potential as dietary interventions.

         <title>Mediterranean Diet Modulates Gene Expression of Cholesterol Efflux Receptors in High‐Risk Cardiovascular Patients</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, Volume 69, Issue 13, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The graphical abstract (GA) displays the study of two randomized trials studying the molecular mechanisms of cholesterol efflux‐related genes analyzed via transcriptomics after two Mediterranean diet interventions. Cholesterol efflux molecules include ATP‐binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 in cholesterol transport to HDL. It also depicts the transcriptional regulation, key in the cholesterol efflux process, by nuclear receptors (NR1H2, NR1H3, RXRA, RXRB, PPARA, PPARD, and PPARG).








ABSTRACT
In this study, we investigated gene expression related to cholesterol efflux receptors in individuals at high cardiovascular risk undergoing Mediterranean dietary interventions. Through transcriptomic analysis, we examined samples from two randomized controlled trials: PREDIMED and PREDIMED‐Plus, with 151 and 89 elderly adults, respectively. Blood cells were isolated at baseline and after a 12‐month intervention. In the PREDIMED trial, participants followed different Mediterranean diets: one supplemented with extra‐virgin olive oil (traditional Mediterranean diet enriched with extra‐virgin olive oil [MedDiet‐EVOO]), another with nuts (MedDiet enriched with nuts MedDiet‐Nuts [MedDiet‐Nuts]), and a low‐fat control diet. The PREDIMED‐Plus trial compared an energy‐reduced Mediterranean diet (Er‐MedDiet) with physical activity to an ad libitum Mediterranean diet. Over time, mild but significant upregulation of genes like ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA), retinoid X receptor beta (RXRB), and Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group H Member 3 (NR1H3) was observed in response to MedDiet‐EVOO, MedDiet‐Nuts, and Er‐MedDiet. Notably, RXRA expression was higher in both MedDiet‐EVOO and MedDiet‐Nuts compared to the control diet. Differences in gene expression, particularly RXRA, ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1), NR1H3, and Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Delta (PPARD), were evident between MedDiet‐Nuts and the control diet. In the PREDIMED‐Plus trial, no significant differences in gene expression were found between dietary groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) showed overlapping gene expression profiles across different Mediterranean diet interventions. In conclusion, our study highlights the cardiovascular health benefits of long‐term adherence to a Mediterranean diet, both normocaloric and hypocaloric, primarily reflected by mild upregulation of cholesterol efflux‐related genes—specifically involving RXRA, RXRB, ABCA1, ABCG1, Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group H Member 2(NR1H2), and PPARD—among elderly adults at high cardiovascular risk. This suggests a potential mechanism by which these diets may exert cardiovascular protective effects.

         <title>Neuroprotective Effects of Shrimp Oil Against Oxidative Stress in Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion Rats</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, Volume 69, Issue 13, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shrimp oil, which contains astaxanthin, n‐3 fatty acids, and DHA, exhibited anti‐oxidative stress effects through activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulation of HO‐1 and SOD, and resulting in reduced free radicals and neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, shrimp oil also attenuated phosphorylated Tau protein levels and enhanced synaptic plasticity via the BDNF/CREB pathway, thereby improving cognitive impairment in rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.








ABSTRACT
Shrimp oil is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and astaxanthin, which possesses high antioxidant activity. This study aimed to investigate the impact of shrimp oil on protection of brain damage and improvement of neurological outcomes after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Male Wistar rats were subjected to occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries and were divided into six groups: sham‐operated, 2‐vessel occlusion (2VO), 2VO‐treated with shrimp oil at the dose of 130, 260, and 520 mg/mL, and 2VO‐treated with resveratrol. Shrimp oil or resveratrol was administered via oral gavage after surgery once a day for 4 weeks. Shrimp oil reduced the level of cerebral damage after CCH associated with lower oxidative stress as indicated by attenuation of the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and 4‐hydroxynonenal (4‐HNE). The shrimp oil treatment also initiated the antioxidant‐mediated nuclear factor E2‐related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme‐oxygenase (HO‐1) pathway, reduced the hyperphosphorylation of tau, reduced neuronal cell death, promoted synaptic plasticity, and consequently promoted cognitive function. Shrimp oil exhibited neuroprotective effects against CCH‐induced cognitive impairment, which could be partially mediated through regulation of oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis.

Moreover, shrimp oil also attenuated phosphorylated Tau protein levels and enhanced synaptic plasticity via the BDNF/CREB pathway, thereby improving cognitive impairment in rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shrimp oil is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and astaxanthin, which possesses high antioxidant activity. This study aimed to investigate the impact of shrimp oil on protection of brain damage and improvement of neurological outcomes after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Male Wistar rats were subjected to occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries and were divided into six groups: sham-operated, 2-vessel occlusion (2VO), 2VO-treated with shrimp oil at the dose of 130, 260, and 520 mg/mL, and 2VO-treated with resveratrol. Shrimp oil or resveratrol was administered via oral gavage after surgery once a day for 4 weeks. Shrimp oil reduced the level of cerebral damage after CCH associated with lower oxidative stress as indicated by attenuation of the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). The shrimp oil treatment also initiated the antioxidant-mediated nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme-oxygenase (HO-1) pathway, reduced the hyperphosphorylation of tau, reduced neuronal cell death, promoted synaptic plasticity, and consequently promoted cognitive function. Shrimp oil exhibited neuroprotective effects against CCH-induced cognitive impairment, which could be partially mediated through regulation of oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lactobacillus reuteri (Limosilactobacillus reuteri) TISTR 2736 Supplementation Attenuates Vascular Injury and Oxidative Stress in Rats Fed a High‐Cholesterol Diet</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, Volume 69, Issue 13, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The consumption of L. reuteri TISTR 2736 ameliorated a high‐cholesterol diet (HCD)‐induced vascular endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in rats by inhibiting ROS production through modulation of LOX‐1, NADPH oxidase, and uncoupled eNOS, while enhancing the antioxidant defense system via activation of the Nrf2/HO‐1 signaling pathway.








ABSTRACT
Hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress are significantly related to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Probiotic supplements have been demonstrated to reduce hyperlipidemia and might minimize atherosclerotic risk. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic ability of Lactobacillus reuteri TISTR 2736 (LR) on vascular damage in high‐cholesterol diet (HCD)‐induced hyperlipidemic rats and elucidate their possible mechanisms. Male Sprague–Dawley rats received a standard diet or HCD, and LR (2 × 108 CFU/rat/day) was orally administered to HCD‐fed rats for 8 weeks. Compared to the HCD‐fed group, LR administration reduced serum levels of TC, TG, LDL, and endothelin‐1 but elevated levels of aortic nitric oxide and serum HDL. Additionally, LR reversed the HCD‐induced aortic histological changes. The protein levels of adhesion molecules (VCAM‐1 and ICAM‐1), lectin‐like oxidized low‐density lipoprotein receptor‐1 (LOX‐1), NADPH oxidase subunits p47phox, eNOS monomer/dimer ratio, oxidative stress markers (4‐hydroxynonenal and 3‐nitrotyrosine), and pro‐inflammatory cytokines (TNF‐α and IL‐6) were decreased, while those of nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase‐1 (HO‐1), and the activity of superoxide dismutase were increased in the aortas of LR‐treated rats. These findings suggest that LR supplementation ameliorates HCD‐induced vascular dysfunction and inflammation, possibly by lowering hyperlipidemia, suppressing ROS production, and increasing antioxidant enzyme activities.

         <title>Tomato Puree Enrichment in a High‐Fat Meal Reduces Postprandial Plasma and Adipose Tissue Inflammation Biomarkers in Healthy Male Adults: A Crossover Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, Volume 69, Issue 13, July 2025. </description>

Tomato puree enrichment in the context of a high‐fat meal in healthy adult males leads to a significant reduction of systemic postprandial and adipose tissue postprandial inflammation.








ABSTRACT
The postprandial period is marked by increased plasma inflammatory biomarkers and heightened adipose tissue inflammation. Consumption of tomato‐based products has been linked to reduced inflammation, potentially lowering the risk of cardiometabolic diseases. This study investigated the addition of tomato puree to a high‐fat meal (HFM) on postprandial inflammation in healthy men. Thirty‐nine healthy men participated in a randomized crossover trial (NCT02100774). Two meals were given: a HFM and the same HFM with 100 g tomato puree (TPM). Blood samples and adipose tissue biopsies were taken at various timepoints to measure inflammatory markers. TPM reduced plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF‐α), interleukin (IL)‐6, and C‐C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)‐2, and gene expression of TNFA, IL6, IL1B, and CCL5 in adipose tissue. In contrast, HFM increased IL‐1β, CCL2, and adipose gene expressions of IL6, IL1B, and CCL2. Variations and net incremental area under the curve (iAUCsnet) between groups showed significantly lower inflammatory markers in TPM, except for plasma CCL2 and CCL5 expression. Incorporating tomato puree in HFM reduces both systemic and adipose tissue inflammation during the postprandial period. These findings suggest that tomato‐based products may contribute to the reduction of postprandial inflammation, potentially explaining their cardiometabolic benefits.

         <title>Preferential Therapeutic Potential of Ficus carica Against Monosodium Glutamate and Metanil Yellow‐Evoked Hepato‐Renal Injury: In Vivo and In Silico Approaches</title>

Proposed mechanisms underlying the protective effects of Ficus carica against monosodium glutamate or metanil yellow‐induced hepatorenal injury.








ABSTRACT
Food preservatives can break food safety worldwide; herein, we studied the mitigating effect of Ficus carica (FC) on hepato‐renal injury resulting from monosodium glutamate (MSG) or metanil yellow (MY) as a common food preservative. Rats were assigned into five groups; Control, MSG (400 mg/kg), MY (200 mg/kg), FC+MSG (received FC plus MSG), and FC+MY group (received FC plus MY). The antioxidant properties of FC were evaluated. The results revealed the antioxidant potency of FC leave extract. MSG/MY evoked a hepato‐renal injury indicated by marked elevations in their biochemical functions. Besides, oxidative damage was also initiated represented by significant increases in MDA levels and decreases in GSH content and SOD activity accompanied by apoptotic cascade (increases in Bax/Bcl2 ratio and caspase3 expression). The molecular docking ascertained the interaction between MSG/MY and cellular antioxidants. However, FC was able to reduce the MSG/MY‐induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and histopathological alterations as well as improve the liver and kidney functions. In the molecular docking model, the natural bioactive compounds of FC explored high affinities for binding with Bax and caspase‐3 abrogating the induced apoptosis. The antioxidant potential of FC mitigated the hepato‐renal damage in rats caused by MSG or MY.

         <title>Association Between Plant‐Based Diet and Continuous Glucose Monitoring‐Derived Glycemic Dynamics Among Pregnant Women With Gestational Diabetes</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, Volume 69, Issue 13, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study comprehensively profiled the associations between plant‐based diet indices and the CGM‐derived metrics among pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Increasing overall plant‐based food intake or decreasing intake of unhealthy plant‐based foods is beneficial for glycemic management in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus.








ABSTRACT

We aim to investigate the association of plant‐based diets with the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)‐derived glycemic metrics among gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) patients. We included 1756 GDM patients in the present analyses and assessed plant‐based dietary patterns through constructing a plant‐based diet index (PDI), healthy PDI (hPDI), and unhealthy PDI (uPDI). CGM‐glycemic metrics, such as time in range (TIR), mean blood glucose (MBG), time below range (TBR), low blood glucose index (LBGI), mean of daily differences (MODD), and glycemic risk assessment in diabetes equation (GRADE), were constructed. We found that individuals in the highest quartile of PDI were more likely to have greater TIR (β: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.41) and MBG (β: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.36), while lower TBR (β: −0.26, 95% CI: −0.39 to −0.12), LBGI (β: −0.18, 95% CI: −0.32 to −0.05), and GRADE (β: −0.25, 95% CI: −0.39 to −0.11), compared to those in the lowest quartile. Moreover, most of these associations demonstrated a dose‐response relationship, and hPDI and uPDI showed distinct associations with MODD, with higher hPDI favoring a healthier MODD pattern (FDR &lt; 0.05). This study suggests potential benefits of increasing intake of plant‐based food for glycemic management among GDM patients.

         <title>Tibetan Tea Alleviates the Intestinal Dysfunction in Sleep‐Deprived Mice Through Regulating Oxidative Stress and Inflammation‐Related Intestinal Metabolisms</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, Volume 69, Issue 13, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sleep deprivation disrupts intestinal homeostasis by elevating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and inducing inflammatory responses. The Tibetan tea water‐soluble extract (TTE) mitigates intestinal dysfunction in sleep‐deprived mice through the reduction of ROS, restoration of intestinal barrier integrity, and modulation of gut microbiota composition. TTE supplementation ameliorates mucosal damage, promotes probiotic enrichment, and alleviates metabolic disturbances, particularly in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, urea cycle, and triglyceride‐related metabolism. These findings underscore the potential of Tibetan tea as a dietary intervention for treating intestinal dysfunction associated with sleep disorders.








ABSTRACT
Sleep deprivation (SD) disrupts intestinal homeostasis through excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Tibetan tea is a potential dietary intervention for inflammation, it's effect on SD‐induced intestinal inflammation remains unclear. This study investigates the alleviating effects of Tibetan tea water‐soluble extract (TTE) on intestinal dysfunction in SD mice. After TTE supplementation, the physiological activity, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress levels were assessed in SD‐induced intestinal dysfunction mice. SD increased ROS levels and pro‐inflammatory cytokines in plasma and small intestine, causing intestinal injury characterized by reduced goblet cells, decreased Mucin2 (MUC2) expression, and impaired tight junction proteins. Conversely, TTE reversed these disorders and improved mucosal injury in the small intestine. Furthermore, TTE modulated gut microbiota by enriching probiotics linked to SCFA production and restored SD‐induced metabolic disturbances in the small intestine and systemic circulation, particularly affecting tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, urea cycle, and TAG‐related metabolites. Overall, TTE remarkably ameliorated SD‐induced intestinal dysfunction through reducing ROS, restoring intestinal barrier function, and regulating the gut microbiome, which suggested that Tibetan tea could contribute to the treatment of intestinal inflammation.

Definition of NAFLD: Fatty liver index (FLI) was used to diagnose the presence of NAFLD. The following formula was used to calculate the FLI, and when participants whose FLI ≥ 60 will be defined as NAFLD:
FLI=e0.953×lnTGmg/dL+0.139×BMIkg/m2+0.718×lnGGTU/L+0.053×WCcm−15.7451+e0.953×lnTGmg/dL+0.139×BMIkg/m2+0.718×lnGGTU/L+0.053×WCcm−15.745×100${\mathrm{FLI}} = \frac{{{{\mathrm{e}}^{\left[ {0.953 \times \ln \left( {{\mathrm{TG}}\left[ {{\mathrm{mg}}/{\mathrm{dL}}} \right]} \right) + 0.139 \times {\mathrm{BMI}}\left[ {{\mathrm{kg}}/{{\mathrm{m}}^2}} \right] + 0.718 \times \ln \left( {{\mathrm{GGT}}\left[ {{\mathrm{U}}/{\mathrm{L}}} \right]} \right) + 0.053 \times {\mathrm{WC}}\left[ {{\mathrm{cm}}} \right] - 15.745} \right]}}}}{{1 + {{\mathrm{e}}^{\left[ {0.953 \times \ln \left( {{\mathrm{TG}}\left[ {{\mathrm{mg}}/{\mathrm{dL}}} \right]} \right) + 0.139 \times {\mathrm{BMI}}\left[ {{\mathrm{kg}}/{{\mathrm{m}}^2} } \right] + 0.718 \times \ln \left( {{\mathrm{GGT}}\left[ {{\mathrm{U}}/{\mathrm{L}}} \right]} \right) + 0.053 \times {\mathrm{WC}}\left[ {{\mathrm{cm}}} \right] - 15.745} \right]}}}} \times 100$ Conclusions: Higher UPF consumption is linked to increased NAFLD risk.

ABSTRACT
The association between ultra‐processed foods (UPFs) consumption and non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains unclear; therefore, we investigated the association between UPF consumption and the risk of NAFLD among Korean adults. This cohort study included 44 642 Korean adults aged 40–69 years, utilizing data from the Health Examinees database. UPF were categorized according to the NOVA classification system based on the degree of processing. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model assessed the association between UPF consumption and NAFLD risk. Over a 4.2‐year follow‐up period, 1562 (3.5%) participants developed NAFLD. After adjusting for potential confounders, higher UPF consumption was associated with a 35% (6%, 71%) and 48% (19%, 86%) increased risk of NAFLD in men and women, respectively. Similar results were observed in both continuous and sensitivity analyses. Among the diverse UPF subtypes, ramen consumption showed the strongest adverse association with NAFLD risk in both men and women (hazard ratio = 2.05 [1.59, 2.65] in men; 1.80 [1.48, 2.19] in women). Our findings suggest that higher UPF consumption is linked to an increased risk of NAFLD. Further comprehensive investigations in a broader spectrum of populations are warranted to corroborate and fortify these results.

         <title>Potential of Ginger Oil to Prevent 4‐(Methylnitrosamino)‐1‐(3‐Pyridyl)‐1‐Butanone‐Induced Lung Cancer Through Gut Microbiota Modulation and Inflammatory Response Inhibition</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, Volume 69, Issue 13, July 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ginger oil (GIO) attenuated NNK‐induced lung tumorigenesis through dual modulation of gut microbiota diversity/metabolic profiles and inflammatory signaling cascades. It suppressed TLR4/MyD88/NF‐κB axis activation while activating PPARγ and inhibiting NF‐κB‐driven inflammation, ultimately reducing pro‐inflammatory cytokines and creating an unfavorable microenvironment for carcinogenesis. This multi‐target mechanism highlights GIO's potential as a dietary strategy against tobacco‐associated lung carcinogenesis.








ABSTRACT
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer‐related mortality worldwide, with tobacco carcinogens such as 4‐(methylnitrosamino)‐1‐(3‐pyridyl)‐1‐butanone (NNK) playing a central role in its pathogenesis. Chemoprevention through dietary or natural compounds offers a promising strategy to mitigate cancer risk. Published studies have indicated that ginger oil (GIO), a bioactive extract from ginger, possesses various bioactivities, suggesting its potential for cancer chemopreventive. In this study, we aimed to investigate the lung cancer chemopreventive potential of GIO. An NNK‐induced lung cancer model in A/J mice was utilized to evaluate the preventive effect of GIO against lung cancer. Additionally, the potential mechanisms by which GIO might prevent NNK‐induced lung cancer were assessed using molecular biology techniques combined with multi‐omics. The results demonstrated that GIO decreased the number of lung tumors in the lungs of mice. Mechanistically, GIO exerts chemopreventive effects by modulating both the TLR4/NF‐κB and PPARγ/NF‐κB signaling axes, thereby suppressing downstream pro‐inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, GIO modulates gut microbiota composition and its metabolites. Critically, its lung chemopreventive efficacy against NNK‐induced lung carcinogenesis is partially dependent on microbiota‐mediated regulation. Overall, these findings underscore the nutritional value of GIO as a diet‐derived chemopreventive agent against lung cancer caused by tobacco carcinogens.

         <title>Lactobacillus rhamnosus PB01 Oral Supplementation Alleviates Metabolic and Reproductive Dysfunctions in Type 1 Diabetic Male Rats</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Type 1 diabetes mellitus is known to impair reproductive function in males of reproductive age. This study investigated the effects of a 7‐week course of oral supplementation with the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus PB01 on metabolic and fertility parameters in diabetic male rats. Supplementation resulted in notable improvements in body weight, insulin sensitivity, testosterone levels, and sperm quality. These findings suggest that probiotics may help counteract the adverse effects of diabetes on male fertility.








ABSTRACT
This study investigated the potential therapeutic effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus PB01 supplementation on metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) rat model. Diabetic rats treated with L. rhamnosus PB01 (1 × 10⁹ CFU/day) showed significant improvements in metabolic and reproductive outcomes. Specifically, diabetes‐induced weight loss was mitigated by approximately 13%, and the percentage of hyperactivated sperm in the treatment group was significantly 2.5 times higher than that of the diabetic controls. Additionally, testosterone levels were significantly elevated by 27%, further supporting the positive effects on reproductive health. The probiotic supplementation also led to improvements in insulin sensitivity, as evidenced by a 34.12% reduction in homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR). L. rhamnosus PB01 (DSM 14870) demonstrated potential as an adjunct therapy for managing T1DM‐associated complications in the rat model, by improving insulin sensitivity, supporting weight management, and partially restoring diabetes‐related fertility impairments, likely through modulation of hormonal pathways. However, further studies are needed to translate the results to humans and refine optimal dosing and supplementation duration for sustained benefits.

         <title>Glycyrrhizic Acid From Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fish: A Novel Therapeutic Candidate for Alzheimer's Disease Targeting the JNK Signaling Pathway</title>

         <dc:description>
A flowchart of network pharmacological and experimental studies on glycyrrhizic acid, which is a major component of licorice, as well as its mechanism of action in Alzheimer's disease (AD) models.








ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has emerged as a prevalent public health concern. This study aims to investigate the mechanism of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fish. in AD through the utilization of network pharmacology, molecular docking, and in vitro validation techniques. Based on gene expression, a gene network was constructed to identify the core target genes related to Aβ and Tau, and the effective compounds of G. uralensis Fisch. were screened by contribution index (CI), which reflects the relative importance of each gene for Aβ/Tau. Molecular docking analysis revealed that glycyrrhizic acid (GA) strongly binds to these core targets. Next, an in vitro model of AD was established by inducing microglia with Aβ1‐42. This model was used to assess the effects of GA on microglial apoptosis, migration, and inflammation. RT‐qPCR (real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction) results indicated that GA lowered the expression of Tbk1 (TANK‐binding kinase 1) and Soat1 (sterol O‐acyltransferase 1) while simultaneously increasing the expression of Slc2a3 (solute carrier family 2 member 3). Additionally, Western Blot results suggested that GA inhibited the JNK signaling pathway. This demonstrates its anti‐apoptotic and anti‐inflammatory properties. Therefore, GA, through its modulation of key signaling pathways and gene expression, is expected to be a potential therapeutic candidate for AD. This study reveals that GA, a key compound in G. uralensis Fish, alleviates AD pathology by targeting Aβ/Tau‐related genes (Tbk1, Soat1, and Slc2a3) and inhibiting the JNK pathway.

         <title>Altered Abundance of Butyrate‐Producing Lachnospiraceae by Maternal Diet During Pregnancy Potentially Influences MASLD‐Related Lipid Dysregulation in Male Rat Offspring</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exposure to undernutrition or overnutrition during the critical period of pregnancy increases susceptibility to metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)–related lipid dysregulation in male rat offspring. The maternal diet during pregnancy altered the relative abundance of specific genera within the Lachnospiraceae family and affected butyrate levels in the offspring in a sex‐specific manner. Several key proteins involved in hepatic lipogenesis and GPx activity were also differentially expressed depending on the sex of the offspring. In conclusion, maternal diet during pregnancy influences the composition of butyrate‐producing gut microbiota and butyrate levels in offspring, potentially predisposing them to MASLD later in life in a sex‐specific manner.








ABSTRACT

The maternal diet during pregnancy is an important factor that influences the intrauterine environment during fetal development. However, the relationship among maternal diet, the gut microbiome of offspring, and health outcomes remains unclear. Here, we report that changes in the gut microbiome of offspring after maternal exposure to 50% food restriction and 45% high‐fat diet during pregnancy can affect the risk of metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in offspring in a sex‐specific manner. Notably, despite no significant difference in body weight, plasma triglyceride and leptin levels were significantly increased in male offspring compared with the controls. The relative abundance of the butyrate‐producing genera of the Lachnospiraceae family was dependent on the sex of the offspring and correlated with plasma triglyceride and leptin levels. Interestingly, male offspring in the 50% restricted diet or 45% high‐fat diet groups had reduced butyrate levels compared with the control group and were affected by oxidative damage and hepatic lipogenesis. Our findings suggest that the maternal diet during pregnancy affects the gut microbiota of male offspring in a sex‐specific manner, potentially predisposing them to MASLD later in life through dysregulation of lipid metabolism.

         <title>Bovine Milk Extracellular Vesicles as a Preventive Treatment for Bone Dysfunction and Metabolic Alterations in Obese Mice Fed a High‐Refined Carbohydrate Diet</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Obesity induction through a high‐refined carbohydrate (HC) diet in BALB/c mice led to increased bone resorption and bone loss in the femur and maxilla. This diet also resulted in increased adiposity, glucose and lipid levels, and insulin resistance. Treatment with bovine milk extracellular vesicles (MEVs) in HC diet‐fed mice demonstrated reduced bone loss and bone resorption associated with decreased adiposity, glucose and lipid levels, and insulin resistance. Therefore, these results demonstrate the promising potential of MEVs as a protective approach to simultaneously address the skeletal and metabolic dysfunction induced by the HC diet.

ABSTRACT
Obesity may cause bone loss due to changes in energy and bone metabolism. Bone loss treatment is still limited, requiring new therapeutic strategies. Bovine milk extracellular vesicles (MEVs) are nanoparticles that act as modulators of cell signaling. While its benefits have already been demonstrated in bone loss, the underlying mechanisms must be better elucidated. To evaluate the effect of MEVs on bone loss in obesity, BALB/c mice were fed a chow diet or a high‐refined carbohydrate (HC) diet for 12 weeks and treated or not with MEVs from the 9th week. Mice fed the HC diet showed bone loss in the maxillary and long bones related to detrimental changes in the bone cell profile. As expected, the HC diet induced hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia, lipid accumulation in adipose and liver, and elevated receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa‐Β ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) ratio and Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) levels. MEV treatment protected from bone loss, increasing osteoblast and osteocyte numbers and reducing osteoclastic activity. Additionally, MEVs diminished adiposity, liver damage, serum glucose, triglyceride, and PTX3 levels, and the RANKL/OPG ratio. MEVs offer a protective effect against bone loss and improve metabolic outcomes in an HC diet‐induced obesity model, suggesting that metabolic improvements may contribute to their bone‐protective role.

         <title>A Moderately High‐Protein Diet During the Critical Development Period Protects Hepatic Functional Integrity and Improves Metabolic Health in Middle‐Aged Offspring via the Gut–Liver Axis</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A moderately mHP diet improves the liver health metabolic phenotype in middle‐aged offspring. A moderately mHP diet enhances key metabolites to maintain energy homeostasis through the gut–liver axis in middle‐aged offspring. A Drosophila model confirms that mHP diet enhances lipid metabolism in middle‐aged offspring via the gut–fat body axis and AMPK/SREBP‐1c pathway.








ABSTRACT
A high‐protein diet (HP) in early life has long‐term effects on the metabolism and liver health of offspring. However, few studies focus on the impact of early nutritional status on the more disease‐susceptible midlife period. Here, we elucidate a moderately HP during critical development and the underlying mechanisms for liver function and metabolic health in middle‐aged offspring. Pregnant Wistar rats are given a 6‐week dietary intervention with a control diet and a moderately HP during gestation and lactation. The maternal high‐protein diet (mHP) group increases energy expenditure, preventing liver fat accumulation and alleviating systemic inflammation of middle‐aged offspring. Additionally, the mHP group reshapes offspring gut microbiota, significantly increasing the abundance of Clostridia_vadinBB60_group, Ruminococcaceae_UBA1819, Flavonifractor, and Butyricicoccaceae_UCG‐009. Metabolomics and transcriptomics reveal that mHP maintains energy homeostasis in middle‐aged offspring by altering serum amino acid, organic acid, and fatty acid profiles and activating the hepatic AMPK/SREBP‐1c pathway to preserve liver integrity via the gut–liver axis. We also demonstrate in the Drosophila model that mHP increases AMPK levels and alleviates lipid accumulation in the gut and fat body of middle‐aged flies. These findings provide valuable insights into the pivotal role of prenatal nutrition in offspring's long‐term health.

         <title>Maternal Dietary Fiber Intake During Lactation and Human Milk Oligosaccharide Fucosylation: a PRIMA Birth Cohort Study</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Healthy breastfeeding women were recruited within the prospective birth cohort PRIMA. We collected a fresh human milk sample at 1 month postpartum to assess relative human milk oligosaccharide (HMO), HMO‐bound fucose levels, and secretor status. In univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis, we did not observe an association between habitual fiber intake and HMO‐bound fucose levels (both regarded prebiotic in nature) within human milk. Created with BioRender.com.








ABSTRACT
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have an important role in the microbiome and immune system development of breastfed infants. Previous explorative studies indicated an association between maternal carbohydrate intake, including dietary fibers, and specific fucosylated HMOs in human milk (HM). Here, we aim to test whether the intake of dietary fibers by breastfeeding mothers is associated with the level of HMO‐bound fucose in HM samples within a prospective birth cohort study. We assessed dietary fiber intake of healthy mothers (n = 164). HMO levels were semi‐quantified in HM samples collected at 1 month postpartum. We found no correlation between fiber intake and HMO‐bound fucose levels. However, secretor mothers (β = 2.22, p &lt; 0.001) and mothers with a baby girl showed a positive correlation (β = 0.41, p = 0.016) with the level of HMO‐bound fucose. In contrast, vaginal delivery negatively correlated with the level of HMO‐bound fucose (β = −4.93, p = 0.008). Overall, there was no association between maternal fiber intake and HMO‐bound fucose levels. Delivery mode, secretor status, and infant sex emerged as the dominant factors associated with HMO fucosylation in HM. Future research should investigate mechanisms underlying HMO fucosylation and its relevance for infant's health.

&lt;p&gt;Healthy breastfeeding women were recruited within the prospective birth cohort PRIMA. We collected a fresh human milk sample at 1 month postpartum to assess relative human milk oligosaccharide (HMO), HMO-bound fucose levels, and secretor status. In univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis, we did not observe an association between habitual fiber intake and HMO-bound fucose levels (both regarded prebiotic in nature) within human milk. &lt;i&gt;Created with BioRender.com&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have an important role in the microbiome and immune system development of breastfed infants. Previous explorative studies indicated an association between maternal carbohydrate intake, including dietary fibers, and specific fucosylated HMOs in human milk (HM). Here, we aim to test whether the intake of dietary fibers by breastfeeding mothers is associated with the level of HMO-bound fucose in HM samples within a prospective birth cohort study. We assessed dietary fiber intake of healthy mothers (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 164). HMO levels were semi-quantified in HM samples collected at 1 month postpartum. We found no correlation between fiber intake and HMO-bound fucose levels. However, secretor mothers (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = 2.22, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and mothers with a baby girl showed a positive correlation (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = 0.41, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.016) with the level of HMO-bound fucose. In contrast, vaginal delivery negatively correlated with the level of HMO-bound fucose (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = −4.93, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008).

         <title>The Functional Ability of Stingless Bees (Lepidotrigona) Propolis on Inflammation‐Related Disorders</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stingless bees (Lepidotrigona) Propolis has great anti‐inflammatory ability by decreasing the level of intracellular ROS, NO production, iNOS, TNF‐α, NF‐κB, and IL‐6 protein expression in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells.








ABSTRACT
The large majority of the bees in the Apidae family are honey bees and stingless bees. Despite honey bees (Apis mellifera) being widely distributed worldwide, Lepidotrigona sp. is a particular genuine stingless bee that can be found only in the Southeast Asia region and Taiwan. Hence, the objectives of this study were firstly to identify Lepidotrigona propolis as an alternative medicine and investigate the anti‐inflammatory effects of on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells by the determination of cell viability, dendritic cell morphology, nitric oxide (NO) production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection, and inflammation‐related proteins analysis. In this study, the polyphenols and flavones in the propolis have been detected by UPLC‐ESI‐MS/MS. Compared to the LPS group, this propolis type also showed decreased NO and ROS production and a change in cell morphology. Additionally, Lepidotrigona propolis can downregulate the expression of some inflammation‐related proteins, such as iNOS, TNF‐α, NF‐κB, and IL‐6. In summary, our study has unveiled the diverse therapeutic properties of Lepidotrigona propolis, particularly its potent anti‐inflammatory effects. This discovery opens up a promising avenue for developing a novel therapeutic alternative for human health, instilling hope for the future of medical science.

         <title>GLP‐1 Responses to a Single Meal Fortified With Oyster Mushroom Powder in Adults With Impaired Glucose Tolerance Depend on the Gut Microbiota Composition Before the Meal</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work showed that the GLP‐1 response to a meal enriched with oyster mushroom powder in adults with impaired glucose tolerance is modulated by the gut microbiome. Higher GLP‐1 responses following the enriched meal were associated with lower microbial evenness and a microbiome more specialized in fiber degradation. Thus, individuals with such a microbiome may especially benefit from this measure.








ABSTRACT
Fortification of a single meal with β‐glucan‐rich oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) powder has been shown to increase the response of glucagon‐like peptide 1 (GLP‐1) and reduce concentrations of non‐esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) in adults with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). This secondary analysis of a randomized controlled crossover study (DRKS00015244) aimed to determine whether these effects are modulated by baseline gut microbiota composition. A fecal sample was collected once at baseline before consumption of either a P. ostreatus‐enriched meal (EN) or a non‐enriched meal (CON). The microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA V3–V4 sequencing. An inverse association was observed between alpha diversity and differences in the meal‐induced GLP‐1 response (p &lt; 0.05), whereas NEFA responses appeared unaffected. Notably, only participants with lower microbial evenness showed a greater GLP‐1 response after EN versus CON (p = 0.012). Additionally, the presence of Eubacterium ventriosum group and Clostridium methylpentosum group was associated with increased GLP‐1 concentrations following EN (p &lt; 0.05). Baseline gut microbiota composition modulates the GLP‐1 response to a single meal fortified with β‐glucan‐rich oyster mushroom powder, with differences in GLP‐1 response being more pronounced in individuals whose microbiome is more specialized in fermenting fiber into SCFAs.

Shen et al. identified NAD+ deficiency as a hallmark of testicular damage under HS. Supplementation with NR effectively restored testicular NAD+ metabolism and improved semen quality, reduced spermatogenesis defects, and attenuated inflammation induced by HS. 








ABSTRACT

Rising global temperatures and increasing extreme weather events have profound and widespread health impacts, particularly on vulnerable populations and sensitive organs. This study aimed to investigate the impact of HS on testicular NAD+ metabolism and assess the potential of NAD+ precursor supplementation in alleviating heat stress (HS)‐induced reductions in semen quality. This study aimed to investigate the impact of HS on testicular NAD+ metabolism and assess the potential of NAD+ precursor supplementation in alleviating HS‐induced reductions in semen quality. In this study, 24 Rongchang boars were randomly divided into three groups: a control group (CON), HS group, and HS supplementation with nicotinamide riboside group (HS‐NR). After the initial feeding phase, the boars were exposed to either a thermoneutral or HS environment for 2 weeks. In this study, we identified NAD+ deficiency as a hallmark of testicular damage under HS. Supplementation with NR effectively restored testicular NAD+ metabolism. NR supplementation also improved semen quality, reduced spermatogenesis defects, and attenuated oxidative stress and inflammation induced by HS. These findings highlight the potential of NAD+ precursors as a promising nutritional strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of HS on male reproductive health.

         <title>Anti‐Inflammatory and Antibacterial Properties of Curcuma longa Extract Against Helicobacter pylori</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explored the effects of Curcuma longa extract (CLE) against H. pylori infection. CLE contained 18 chemical compounds and completely inhibited growth of H. pylori Sydney strain 1 (SS1) in vitro. In infected mice with H. pylori SS1, oral administration of CLE successfully eradicated H. pylori from the stomach without causing toxicity, suggesting its potential as a natural and safe therapy.








ABSTRACT

Helicobacter pylori is a Gram‐negative, microaerophilic bacterium that colonizes the human stomach, causing gastritis, gastric ulcers, and gastric cancer. This study investigated the anti‐Helicobacter and anti‐inflammatory effects of Curcuma longa extract (CLE) as a potential treatment for H. pylori infection.


Ultra‐high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (UPLC‐Q‐TOF/MS) analysis identified 18 chemical compounds in CLE, with curcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, and bisacurone as major active components. In vitro experiments demonstrated that CLE completely inhibited the growth of H. pylori Sydney strain 1 (SS1) in a dose‐dependent manner and exhibited synergistic effects when combined with amoxicillin. In a mouse model infected with H. pylori SS1 showed that oral administration of CLE for 4 weeks effectively eradicated H. pylori from the stomach without causing toxicity, as evidenced by the CLO test and reduced levels of H. pylori‐associated genes. Furthermore, CLE attenuated inflammatory cell infiltration in the gastric mucosa of infected mice and significantly reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases in H. pylori‐infected AGS cells, a human gastric cancer cell line.


These findings suggest that CLE is a promising candidate for the treatment of H. pylori infection, exhibiting potent antibacterial and anti‐inflammatory properties.

         <title>Dietary Supplement With Tribulus terrestris L. Extract Exhibits Protective Effects on Neuroinflammation</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anti‐inflammatory activity of active fraction (TTAI) extract from Tribulus terrestris was evaluated by qRT‐PCR and ELISA, through metabolomics and transcriptomics suggested that TTAI function through PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways.








ABSTRACT
Among herbal dietary supplements, an extract called Tribulus terrestris L. (TT) was widely used. We extracted an anti‐neuroinflammatory active fraction (TTAI) from TT and demonstrated that it is expected to be developed as a dietary supplement for ameliorating neuroinflammation through activity and mechanism exploration. The anti‐inflammatory activity of TT extract was evaluated by quantitative real‐time PCR (qRT‐PCR) and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The data showed that TTAI significantly reduced the LPS‐induced increase in the levels of inflammatory factors in BV‐2 cells. In addition, TTAI significantly elevates the level of anti‐inflammatory factors. We applied metabolomics and transcriptomics to explore the pathways and targets underlying the therapeutic impact of TTAI in treating neuroinflammation. The results showed that TTAI could reverse the expression of 40 metabolic biomarkers that significantly changed in LPS‐induced BV‐2 inflammation models, including Cer, LPC, LPI, serine, lysin, and arginine, TTAI effectively regulated the expression levels of 235 genes, including Ptgs1, Pla2g7, and Plin2. Our data suggested that TTAI may function through PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. This study uncovers the mechanisms behind the efficacy of TTAI in treating neuroinflammation, which not only confirms its potential as a dietary supplement, but also expands its potential medicinal applications.

         <title>A Pomegranate Polyphenol Extract Suppresses the Microbial Production of Proatherogenic Trimethylamine (TMA) in an In Vitro Human Colon Model</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimethylamine N‐oxide (TMAO) is associated with various cardiometabolic and other diseases and can cause thrombosis and vascular inflammation. Dietary l‐carnitine and choline are metabolized by gut microbiota to trimethylamine (TMA), which is oxidized to TMAO in the liver. This study shows that a pomegranate extract significantly inhibits the conversion of l‐carnitine and choline to TMA by gut microbiota.








ABSTRACT
High circulating levels of trimethylamine N‐oxide (TMAO) are linked to metabolic diseases, adverse outcomes after heart failure, and atherogenic effects in animal models and in human subjects. l‐Carnitine and choline are major dietary precursors of TMAO. These are first converted to trimethylamine (TMA) by gut microbiota, which is absorbed by the host and converted into TMAO by hepatic flavin‐containing monooxygenases (FMOs). The minimal absorption of pomegranate polyphenols by the host suggests that they may reach the colon for further metabolism by the gut microbiome. This study investigates the ability of a polyphenol‐rich pomegranate extract to inhibit TMA production by human fecal microbiota. Batch fermentations were conducted with 1% human fecal inoculum, l‐carnitine, or choline, and a pomegranate extract (anaerobic, pH 6.6–7.1, 37°C) for 24 or 48 h. Methylamines were quantified using LC‐MS/MS with isotopically labeled internal standards. The pomegranate extract significantly delayed and reduced the rate of TMA production from both choline and l‐carnitine. The effect was dose‐dependent for l‐carnitine, with the highest dose delaying the average midpoint of l‐carnitine metabolism by 16 h (95% CI = 8.4‐24; p = 0.001). The pomegranate extract significantly reduced TMA production from choline and l‐carnitine in vitro.

         <title>Therapeutic Potential of Cinnamic Acid as an SGLT2 Inhibitor in Mitigating Diabetic Nephropathy in a Rat Model of Type 2 Diabetes</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphical abstract by which cinnamic acid (CA) alleviates hyperglycemia and protects against renal damage in Type‐2 diabetic rats. Accordingly, CA downregulates the SLT2 receptor in the proximal tubules, thus reducing glucose absorption. In turn, this suppresses the generation of oxidative stress and inflammation in the proximal cells by decreasing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibiting the toll‐like receptor. In addition, suppressing treatment with CA boosts the levels of endogenous antioxidant enzymes.








ABSTRACT
This study investigates the renal protective effects of cinnamic acid (CA) in a Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rat model induced by high‐fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ), with a focus on its potential as a natural hypoglycemic agent and SGLT2 inhibitor. In a randomized design, five groups of rats (n = 8) were administered different treatments for 8 weeks: Control, Control + CA (40 mg/kg), T2DM, T2DM + CA (20 mg/kg), and T2DM + CA (40 mg/kg). CA treatment (20 and 40 mg/kg) significantly improved the glomerular and tubular structure in T2DM group, with normal features observed at the highest dose. In a dose‐dependent manner, CA doses also reduced fasting glucose, HbA1c, and HOMA‐IR in T2DM group, alongside enhanced total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Notably, renal function was significantly improved with CA treatment at both doses, as evidenced by reduced urine volume, serum BUN, creatinine, and urinary albumin. Furthermore, CA markedly reduced glomerular injury markers (NAG, A1M, F‐LAP) and tubular injury biomarkers (transferrin, fibronectin, ceruloplasmin). Additionally, mRNA expression of SGLT, TLR4, and NF‐kB was significantly reduced in CA‐treated T2DM group. These findings suggest that CA exerts a multifaceted protective effect against renal dysfunction in T2DM by acting as an SGLT2 inhibitor.

         <title>Protective Role of the Natural Antioxidant Astaxanthin in Both Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells (BEAS‐2B) and Non‐Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells (H1975) Exposed to Cadmium: Impact on the Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species and Cancer Cell Migration</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study addresses the impact of Cd, alone or combined with astaxanthin (ATX), in human non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (H1975) and nonmalignant bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS‐2B). Cd exhibits concentration‐dependent cytotoxic effects, particularly at high concentrations, with differential sensitivity between nonmalignant and malignant cells. No significant alterations in the intracellular and extracellular metabolome were observed upon Cd exposure. Cd promoted NSCLC cell migration as well as ROS production, which was counteracted by ATX.








ABSTRACT

Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal and human carcinogen that displays toxicity to many organ systems. This work addresses the impact of Cd, alone or combined with astaxanthin (ATX), in human non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (H1975) and nonmalignant bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS‐2B). The endpoints selected comprise cell viability, migration, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and a metabolomic study. Cd (up to 140 µM) was evaluated with the crystal violet (CV) and MTS assays and revealed cytotoxicity at high concentrations, with greater extent in nonmalignant cells. ATX (up to 20 µM) revealed no cytotoxicity. Cd increased ROS generation (dichlorodihydro‐fluorescein diacetate fluorometric assay) in a concentration‐dependent manner for both cell lines, with this effect being reverted by ATX. Cd at noncytotoxic concentrations (up to 10 µM) increased collective cell migration, with this pro‐migratory effect being mitigated upon ATX co‐treatment. The metabolome analysis yielded no significant metabolic alterations in the endo‐ or exometabolome. Overall, Cd exhibits cytotoxicity in lung cells, with differential sensitivity between nonmalignant and malignant cells. Importantly, Cd promotes NSCLC cell migration and ROS production in lung cells, which can be ameliorated by ATX, reinforcing the protective properties of this dietary carotenoid against toxic exposures.

         <title>Regulation of Intestinal Inflammation in Large Yellow Croaker (Larimichthys crocea) by Soybean Globulin via Toll‐Like Receptor Signaling</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates how soybean 11S globulin induces intestinal inflammation in large yellow croaker through TLR5M/S‐mediated activation of the NF‐κB and MAPK pathways, supported by molecular docking, SPR analysis, and cytokine expression changes in Lyck cells.








ABSTRACT
Larimichthys crocea, an economically significant fish species, has experienced significant resource depletion due to overfishing, prompting the expansion of aquaculture. However, the utilization of plant‐based protein sources, like soybean globulin, in aquafeeds may induce intestinal inflammation, compromising fish health. In this study, models of Toll‐like receptor (TLR) gene expression were constructed using dual‐luciferase reporter vectors. TLR5M and TLR5S were identified as key mediators of inflammatory responses through the activation of the MAPK and NF‐κB signaling. Molecular docking analyses confirmed their high binding affinity with soybean globulin. Western blot analyses further validated significant changes in key proteins of these pathways. This study provides theoretical insights into plant protein‐induced intestinal inflammation and supports the optimization of aquafeed formulations to enhance aquaculture efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates how soybean 11S globulin induces intestinal inflammation in large yellow croaker through TLR5M/S-mediated activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, supported by molecular docking, SPR analysis, and cytokine expression changes in Lyck cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Larimichthys crocea&lt;/i&gt;, an economically significant fish species, has experienced significant resource depletion due to overfishing, prompting the expansion of aquaculture. However, the utilization of plant-based protein sources, like soybean globulin, in aquafeeds may induce intestinal inflammation, compromising fish health. In this study, models of Toll-like receptor (TLR) gene expression were constructed using dual-luciferase reporter vectors. TLR5M and TLR5S were identified as key mediators of inflammatory responses through the activation of the MAPK and NF-κB signaling. Molecular docking analyses confirmed their high binding affinity with soybean globulin. Western blot analyses further validated significant changes in key proteins of these pathways. This study provides theoretical insights into plant protein-induced intestinal inflammation and supports the optimization of aquafeed formulations to enhance aquaculture efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Medicine‐Food Homologous Plantago L. in Gastrointestinal Health and Disease: A Review</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a medicine‐food homologous (MFH) plant, Plantago L. (PL) presents significant potential for the development of food aimed at promoting gastrointestinal health. Its whole herb and seeds are abundant in bioactive compounds, including polysaccharides, flavonoids, and iridoids, which provide anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant, and intestinal barrier‐protective effects. PL modulates gut microbiota, enhances mucosal integrity, and regulates intestinal motility. Despite its widespread availability, research on its active components, mechanisms of action, and clinical applications remains limited. This review systematically summarizes PL's distribution, medicinal history, potential for food development, and multifunctional mechanisms related to gastrointestinal health, offering a theoretical foundation for advancing MFH‐based clinical applications and innovations in functional food. Further interdisciplinary studies are essential to optimize its use in global health industries.








ABSTRACT
Plantago L. (PL) is a notable genus of medicine‐food homologous (MFH) plants, with its primary medicinal components comprising the entire plant and its seeds, which are frequently employed as culinary ingredients. PL is abundant in various bioactive compounds and demonstrates anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant, and intestinal barrier‐protective properties. Furthermore, PL exhibits a dual regulatory effect on both constipation and diarrhea. As a plant resource with a global distribution, PL holds significant promise for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. Nonprescription drugs containing psyllium husk are approved by the FDA for short‐term relief of constipation. Other ingredients from PL also possess significant clinical values in anti‐inflammatory effects, intestinal barrier protection, and regulation of microbiota protection; however, they have not yet been effectively developed. Current research on PL faces several challenges, including insufficient resource investigation and development, unsystematic characterization of chemical components, and unclear elucidation of the mechanisms underlying its gastrointestinal protective biological activity. These issues seriously hinder the clinical and food resource development of PL. This review systematically elucidates the distribution, medicinal history, food development potential, and multifaceted functions of PL in promoting gastrointestinal health, thereby providing valuable insights for clinical applications and the development of food products derived from MFH.

         <title>Protective Effects of Human Milk Oligosaccharides (hMOs) on Analgesic, Nonsteroidal Anti‐inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)‐Induced Disruption of Gut Barrier Integrity in Cocultures Mimicking Neuro‐Gut Epithelial Cell Crosstalk</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nerve cells partially mitigate indomethacin‐induced tight junction dysregulation in neuro‐gut epithelial cell cocultures. Human milk oligosaccharides 2′‐ and 3‐fucosyllactose (2′‐FL and 3‐FL) protect the neuro‐gut epithelial barrier from indomethacin‐induced damage. This protection is stronger in cocultures with higher nerve cell densities.








ABSTRACT
Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like indomethacin alter gut microbiota composition and disrupt intestinal integrity, increasing the risks of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Gut barrier function is regulated by a complex crosstalk between different cell types, including epithelial cells and cells from the enteric nervous system (ENS). Human milk oligosaccharides (hMOs), particularly 2′‐fucosyllactose (2′‐FL) and 3‐fucosyllactose (3‐FL), can regulate intestinal barrier function, but their roles in neuroepithelial crosstalk under NSAID stress remain unclear. This study focused on hMOs’ direct epithelial effects to explore their potential in microbiota‐independent effects caused by the NSAID indomethacin. T84 colorectal carcinoma cells were cocultured with SH‐SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in ratios of 29:1 and 14:1. We evaluated the protective role of hMOs in indomethacin‐induced barrier disruption. We found that indomethacin reduced transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), disrupted F‐actin organization, and decreased tight junction (TJ) protein expression. Pretreatment with 2′‐FL and 3‐FL protected against these effects, particularly in cocultures with a higher nerve cell ratio of 14:1, restoring TEER, F‐actin integrity, and claudin‐1 expression. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of 2′‐FL and 3‐FL in directly maintaining barrier integrity in intestinal neuroepithelial cocultures during NSAID treatment.

         <title>Alcohol Consumption Amount, Drinking Pattern, and the Trajectory of Multimorbidity: A Prospective Cohort Study</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavy alcohol consumption, especially spirits and beer, alcohol consumption without food and binge‐like drinking showed increased risks for the onset, progression, and prognosis of multimorbidity. Alcohol consumption interventions are needed to be integrated into both primary and secondary prevention policies for multimorbidity, which is a cost‐effective preventive strategy to curb the rapidly growing burden of multimorbidity and improve life expectancy.








ABSTRACT

This study aimed to investigate the impacts of both alcohol consumption amount and drinking pattern on the progression from healthy to first noncommunicable disease (FNCD), subsequently to multimorbidity, and ultimately to death.


We conducted this analysis in the UK Biobank cohort (N = 284 744). Multimorbidity was defined as the coexistence of at least two noncommunicable diseases, including cancer, chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and Type 2 diabetes. Multistate model was used to estimate the impacts of alcohol consumption on the whole trajectory of multimorbidity.


Guidelines harmful drinkers showed increased risks of all five transitions of multimorbidity than nondrinkers, with hazard ratios (95% CI) 1.16 (1.09, 1.23) and 1.10 (1.00, 1.22) for transitions from baseline to FNCD, and then to multimorbidity, and 1.40 (1.22, 1.61), 1.37 (1.23, 1.54), and 1.41 (1.19, 1.67) for transitions from baseline, FNCD, and multimorbidity to death. Similar associations were found for spirits and beer consumption, but not red wine. For drinking patterns, drinking without food was associated with higher risks of four transitions except death from multimorbidity than drinking with food.


Our results indicate that both alcohol consumption amount and drinking pattern exert important effects on almost all phases of multimorbidity development.

         <title>Bromelain‐Rich Pineapple Extract for the Treatment of Pediatric Patients With Orchiepididymitis: A Randomized Clinical Pilot Study</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>

From pineapple byproducts to a pharmaceutical formulation.








ABSTRACT
A freeze‐dried pineapple extract—Brome‐Inf, from pineapple by‐products of industrial rings production, was enriched in bioactive polypeptides and bromelain by membrane ultrafiltration. Orchiepididymitis (OE), a painful pediatric pathology, was treated with this extract. A pilot, double‐blind, randomized study involving 60 pediatric OE patients compared the effects of Brome‐Inf to a placebo over a 15‐day period, in conjunction with antibiotic treatment. In the present study, the primary objective was to assess the disparity in NSAIDs usage and pain intensity between the Brome‐Inf group and the placebo group, utilizing the Wong‐Becker, Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain rating scales. Results revealed a significant reduction in VAS and NRS within the Brome‐Inf group from Days 1 to 15 compared with placebo. A rapid regression of edema was observed in the active group after 1 week and at the end of the study. We can conclude that oral supplementation with Brome‐Inf emerges as a promising co‐management option for OE for its action on pain and edema, potentially enhancing the quality of life for affected children. Importantly, due to its well‐balanced fruity flavor, the palatability of Brome‐Inf was appreciated, ensuring optimal patient compliance and treatment safety.

         <title>Postprandial Responses to Meals Enriched With Canola or Coconut Oil in Men and Women With a Risk Phenotype for Cardiometabolic Diseases: A Randomized Crossover Trial</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this randomized crossover study, 29 participants with increased cardiometabolic risk consumed four isoenergetic, isonitrogenous meals containing 25 or 50 g of canola or coconut oil. Blood samples (e.g., for analysis of lipid, glucose, and insulin metabolism) were collected in the fasting state and 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 h postprandially. Besides, vascular function was assessed by measuring arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity, augmentation index) before the test meals and 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 h postprandially.








ABSTRACT
We investigated the metabolic response to meals with canola or coconut oil (rich in unsaturated vs. rich in saturated fatty acids [FAs]). Although the longer‐term metabolic effects of these fats are well evidenced, their postprandial effects remain inconclusive. In this randomized crossover trial, 29 participants with increased cardiometabolic risk consumed four isoenergetic meals containing 25 or 50 g (low‐fat meals [LFMs], high‐fat meals [HFMs]) of canola or coconut oil. Blood samples for analysis of triglycerides (TGs), glucose, insulin, nonesterified FAs (NEFAs), IL‐6, and individual FAs were collected in the fasting state and 6 h postprandially (every 0.5–1 h). The incremental areas under the curves (iAUCs) of TGs and IL‐6 were higher after canola than after coconut oil. Concentrations of lauric and myristic acid were higher after coconut oil, while concentrations of oleic, linoleic, and α‐linolenic acid were higher after canola oil. The TG iAUC was higher after HFMs than after corresponding LFMs. NEFAs decreased more after LFMs than after HFMs. The glucose and insulin iAUCs were higher after LFMs than after HFMs. Canola and coconut oil induced different metabolic responses. The manner and strength of the postprandial effects differed depending on the parameter.

&lt;p&gt;In this randomized crossover study, 29 participants with increased cardiometabolic risk consumed four isoenergetic, isonitrogenous meals containing 25 or 50 g of canola or coconut oil. Blood samples (e.g., for analysis of lipid, glucose, and insulin metabolism) were collected in the fasting state and 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 h postprandially. Besides, vascular function was assessed by measuring arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity, augmentation index) before the test meals and 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 h postprandially.

         <title>Grape Seed Proanthocyanidins: A Potential Microbiome‐Targeted Intervention for Healthy Aging in Rats</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) promotes a healthier gut phenotype in aged rats. Aging alters gut microbiota composition, increases inflammation, and compromises intestinal barrier function. This study shows that short‐term GSPE treatment in aged rats partially restores microbial diversity toward a youthful profile, modulates mucus‐related gene expression, and reduces jejunal inflammation. These findings support GSPE as a microbiome‐targeted intervention to counteract age‐related intestinal decline and promote healthy aging by preserving gut barrier function and microbial homeostasis. This figure was created with BioRender.com.








ABSTRACT
Aging and age‐related metabolic complications are global health issues that pose a serious threat to public health. Gut dysfunction and dysbiosis contribute to age‐related health decline. Grape seed‐derived procyanidins (GSPE) have shown efficacy in mitigating adaptive homeostasis decline in young animal models, but their impact on intestinal health and the gut microbiome in aged animals remains unexplored. Twenty‐one‐month‐old female rats were treated with 500 mg GSPE/kg of body weight for 10 days. After 11 weeks, GSPE anti‐aging potential was evaluated by measuring plasma lipopolysaccharide, gut integrity gene expression, ex vivo gut barrier function, myeloperoxidase activity, and fecal microbiome composition. GSPE shifted the microbiota toward a younger profile, even restoring lost strains in aged rats. Despite the presence of metabolic aging markers, there was minimal deterioration in gut barrier function. Neither ex vivo permeability tests, transcriptional analysis of barrier function, nor gut histology showed significant impairment in gut. Only jejunal myeloperoxidase activity was increased in aged rats and reduced by GSPE. Intestinal barrier function showed mild deterioration in this model of aged rats. GSPE improved the aging process by modulating the gut microbiome, suggesting its potential as a microbiome‐targeted intervention for promoting healthy aging.

         <title>Bottom‐Up Design of Prebiotics and Probiotics: An Intestinal Microbiota‐Centered Approach to Chronic and Functional Constipation Management</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Patients with functional constipation or chronic constipation exhibit distinct alterations in their intestinal microbiota compared to healthy individuals. Specifically, in constipated patients, 12 genera/species of bacteria, including Acinetobacter baumannii, Blautia sp., and so forth, showed a significant decrease, while eight genera/species of bacteria, including Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, and so forth, showed a significant increase. Moreover, variations in some microorganisms have been observed across different studies, such as Bifidobacterium, Acidaminococcus, and a total of nine genera/species. These findings can provide guidance for future constipation intervention through probiotics or prebiotics. Supplementation can be targeted to the genera/strains of bacteria that have significantly decreased in constipated patients or aim to inhibit those that have increased.








ABSTRACT
Chronic constipation (CC) and functional constipation (FC) are common gastrointestinal disorders that significantly affect quality of life. This study investigates the intestinal microbiota characteristics in CC and FC patients, revealing microbial imbalances characterized by reduced beneficial taxa, such as Acinetobacter, Blautia, Dorea formicigenerans, Eubacterium ramulus, and Halomonas, alongside increased levels of Alistipes, Holdemanella, Parabacteroides, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, and so on. These findings highlight dysbiosis as a critical factor in constipation pathogenesis and provide a foundation for the bottom‐up design of targeted probiotics and prebiotics. Potential therapeutic strategies include tailored probiotic formulations to replenish deficient taxa and the application of prebiotics to restore microbial balance. Additionally, the role of microbial metabolites, particularly short‐chain fatty acids, and the microbiota–gut–brain axis offers further insight into mechanisms underlying symptom modulation. The integration of artificial intelligence enhances precision in probiotic design, enabling the prediction of strain‐specific combinations optimized for therapeutic efficacy. This microbiota‐centered approach underscores the potential for personalized interventions in addressing dysbiosis and advancing innovative management for CC and FC.

         <title>Increased Nitrate Intake From Beetroot Juice Over 4 Weeks Changes the Composition of the Oral, But Not the Intestinal Microbiome</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This randomized, double‐blind, and placebo‐controlled crossover study investigated the effects of an increased intake of inorganic nitrate from beetroot juice over 4 weeks on the oral and intestinal microbial communities in older adults with treated high blood pressure. The findings suggest that dietary nitrate from a vegetable source selectively modulates the oral microbial community and promotes an increased abundance of nitrate‐reducing species in the mouth. This may be important for the generation of the vasoactive signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) and was previously associated with improved cardiovascular health outcomes.








ABSTRACT
Inorganic dietary nitrate, metabolized through an endogenous pathway involving nitrate reducing bacteria, improves cardiovascular health, but its effects on the oral and intestinal microbiomes of older adults with treated hypertension are unknown. Our study investigated the effects of nitrate from beetroot juice on the oral and intestinal microbiomes of this population. A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled crossover trial was conducted with 15 participants (age range: 56–71 years), who consumed nitrate‐rich or nitrate‐depleted (placebo) beetroot juice for 4 weeks. The oral microbiome analysis revealed an increase in Neisseria and a decrease in Veillonella relative abundance (for both, PERMANOVA p &lt; 0.001), with no significant changes in the intestinal microbiome composition. Our findings suggest that an increased dietary nitrate intake from a vegetable source may selectively modulate the oral microbiome and promote an increased abundance of nitrate‐reducing species, which was previously associated with improved cardiovascular health outcomes.

         <title>Flavonoid Polyphenols as Therapeutic Agents for Fatty Liver Disease: Mechanisms, Microbiome Interactions, and Metabolic Insights</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reviews the potential of flavonoids in the treatment of fatty liver disease (FLD). This paper focuses on the bioactivity, mechanism of action, and biomarker changes of flavonoid intervention in non‐alcoholic (NAFLD) and alcoholic (AFLD), including its antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and anti‐fibrosis effects, and the regulation of intestinal microbiome effects of flavonoids. The effects of flavonoids on lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity were also discussed, which provided insights for future research.








ABSTRACT
Fatty liver disease (FLD), encompassing non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD), has become a major global health concern, primarily driven by unhealthy diets and lifestyle changes. Recently, flavonoids, which account for approximately 60% of polyphenolic compounds, have garnered attention for their antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties in combating metabolic diseases. This review summarizes recent advancements in the therapeutic potential of flavonoid polyphenols for treating FLD, with a focus on their bioactivity and mechanisms of action, interactions with the gut microbiome, and metabolic effects. The review discusses the bioactivity and biomarkers of flavonoids in treating FLD, their similar and differing roles in NAFLD and AFLD, regulation of gut microbiota, and synergistic mechanisms with other polyphenolic compounds. This review provides insights into the potential applications of flavonoids in treating fatty liver disease and suggests future research directions.

         <title>Nuciferine Inhibits Epithelial‐Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in A549 Cells and Ameliorates Bleomycin‐Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis in Mice via the TGF‐β1/Smad2/3 Signaling Pathway</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study has shown that nuciferine (NCF) effectively inhibits TGF‐β1‐induced epithelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition (EMT) in A549 cells by downregulating mesenchymal markers (vimentin and N‐cadherin) and upregulating epithelial marker (E‐cadherin). It suppresses TGF‐β1 expression and Smad2/3 phosphorylation in a bleomycin (BLM)‐induced lung fibrosis model. This results in reduced transcription of profibrotic genes such as α‐SMA, fibronectin, and collagen I. Consequently, NCF prevents fibroblast‐to‐myofibroblast differentiation and ECM accumulation and eventually helps in the alleviation of pulmonary fibrosis (PF).








ABSTRACT
Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a chronic inflammatory disorder marked by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, leading to lung tissue scarring. This study explores nuciferine (NCF) as a potential therapeutic candidate for PF. In A549 cells, NCF (10 and 20 µM) maintained approximately 80% cell viability. TGF‐β1 (5 ng/mL) was used to induce fibrosis, followed by treatment with NCF. Cell migration assays demonstrated that NCF significantly inhibited TGF‐β1‐induced epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration. At both concentrations, NCF markedly suppressed fibroblast activation. Male C57BL/6 mice were allocated into control, bleomycin (BLM, 2 U/kg), NCF (20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg), and pirfenidone (PFD, 30 mg/kg) groups. NCF and PFD were administered orally for 21 days, starting on the day of BLM administration. Our results showed that NCF restores oxidative balance, enhances antioxidant levels, and decreases IL‐6 levels in BLM‐exposed lungs. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining revealed reduced alveolar and bronchiolar wall thickening with NCF, while collagen staining confirmed decreased collagen deposition. NCF modulated profibrotic proteins (α‐SMA, CTGF, collagen I, fibronectin) and EMT markers (E‐cadherin, N‐cadherin, vimentin). In conclusion, NCF, a lotus‐derived alkaloid with antioxidant properties, alleviates PF by inhibiting EMT, reducing inflammation, and restoring oxidative balance, highlighting its therapeutic potential.

         <title>Coarse Grain Preference, Gut Microbiota Features, in Relation to Hypertriglyceridemia in Constipation Patients: A Cross‐Sectional Study</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grains are the main source of calories in the Chinese diet. We found that in patients with functional constipation, preference for coarse grains over refined grains was associated with lower blood triglyceride levels, and statistical substitution of coarse grains for refined grains reduced the risk of hypertriglyceridemia to varying degrees. We also identified genus features associated with both coarse grain preference and hypertriglyceridemia.








ABSTRACT
Coarse grain (CG) benefits blood lipids involving gut microbiota regulations. Little is known about the relation between CG preference and blood lipids in constipation patients, and related gut microbiota features. Gut microbial genera and dietary information of 249 functional constipation participants are characterized by 16S rRNA sequencing and a food frequency questionnaire. CG preference was defined as a higher CG intake frequency than refined grain (RG) intake frequency. Compared with RG, CG preference was associated with a lower serum triglyceride (TG) (p = 0.015) and a lower risk of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). The reallocations from RG to CG at frequencies of 3, 5, and 10 times per week were associated with reductions in the risk of HTG by 48%, 67%, and 89%, respectively. A machine learning based model using gut microbiota features well identified the likelihood of HTG, with the area under the curve achieving 0.79 (95% CI, 0.65–0.91). Furthermore, the microbiome risk score profiling HTG was negatively correlated with CG preference (r = –0.150, p = 0.021). Preferring coarse grain as a staple food was associated with lower HTG risk and differential gut microbiota features in constipation patients.

         <title>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Red) Rich in Protoporphyrin IX Exerts Anti‐Diabetic Effects in Liver Tissue</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals protoporphyrin IX (PPIX)‐rich Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (red) alleviates T2DM in HFD/STZ mice. It improves glucose/insulin sensitivity, reduces liver lipid deposition/damage, alleviates inflammation and oxidative stress, and inhibits G‐6‐Pase/PEPCK via SOCS2/JAK2/STAT5. A promising dietary intervention for T2DM.








ABSTRACT
The metabolites derived from microalgae have been attributed with various nutritional and medicinal properties. Therefore, our research focused on exploring the potential benefits of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (red) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Mice were subjected to a high‐fat diet and low‐dose streptozotocin injection to develop T2DM. These diabetic mice were then treated orally with either 1% sodium carboxymethylcellulose or C. reinhardtii (red) at 1–3 g/kg BW/day for 4 weeks. Liver sections were stained with hematoxylin‐eosin and oil red to assess pathological changes and lipid deposition. Serum inflammatory factors were measured using ELISA, and oxidative stress indicators were evaluated with commercial kits. C. reinhardtii (red) treatment significantly improved fasting glucose, body weight, triglycerides, LDL‐C, and enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. It also reduced liver damage and lipid deposition. The treatment decreased G‐6‐Pase and PEPCK protein expression and modulated the SOCS2/JAK2/STAT5 pathway. RNA‐seq analysis showed 972 differentially expressed genes in treated diabetic mice. KEGG analysis indicated the involvement of lipid metabolism, inflammation, and multiple pathways in the effects of C. reinhardtii (red). C. reinhardtii (red) might counteract T2DM by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and modulating key metabolic pathways, suggesting its potential as a dietary intervention for patients.

         <title>Hidden Hunger: A Forgotten Comorbidity of Metabolic‐Syndrome‐Associated Fatty Liver Disease</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
M/NAFLD, driven by diabetes‐obesity‐related fat buildup, causes liver injury through oxidative stress and inflammation. Hidden hunger or micronutrient deficiency worsens M/NAFLD but is often overlooked. Socioeconomic and environmental factors limit access to vital nutrients. Shared symptoms complicate diagnosis. Nutrition‐focused interventions, awareness, and holistic diagnostics are essential to prevent, manage, or reverse disease progression and associated liver damage.








ABSTRACT
Metabolic‐syndrome‐associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), formally recognized as non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a growing global health challenge. MAFLD or NAFLD (M/NAFLD) pathophysiology is characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, often driven by metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Micronutrient deficiencies known as “hidden hunger” remain an underexplored comorbidity of M/NAFLD. Hidden hunger, caused by inadequate intake or poor bioavailability of essential vitamins and minerals, can exacerbate the pathophysiology of M/NAFLD through mechanisms such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and impaired lipid metabolism. This review examined the intricate interconnection between hidden hunger and M/NAFLD. Key micronutrients (vitamins D, E, A, and C, zinc, selenium, and magnesium) are critical in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and mitigating liver damage. Their deficiencies can accelerate M/NAFLD progression from simple steatosis to advanced stages like non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. We also highlight the diagnostic challenges posed by overlapping symptoms of hidden hunger and M/NAFLD and emphasize the need for comprehensive screening protocols. Evidence‐based therapeutic strategies, including nutritional interventions and micronutrient supplementation, were explored for their potential to halt or reverse disease progression. We maintained that addressing hidden hunger offers a special chance to enhance results in M/NAFLD patients.

         <title>Sodium Butyrate Enhances 5‐Fluorouracil Sensitivity Through Thymidylate Synthase Regulation and Cell‐Cycle Modulation in Gastric Cancer</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium butyrate (NaB) enhances the anticancer efficacy of 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU) in gastric cancer cells by modulating two key pathways. NaB downregulates thymidylate synthase (TS), a critical enzyme for DNA synthesis, and disrupts RB–E2F signaling, inducing cell‐cycle arrest and apoptosis. Additionally, NaB inhibits mTOR signaling through suppression of 4EBP1 phosphorylation and impairs mitochondrial membrane potential. Together, NaB and 5‐FU synergistically suppress TS activity, promote mitochondrial dysfunction, and intensify apoptosis, thereby improving chemotherapeutic sensitivity.








ABSTRACT

5‐Fluorouracil (5‐FU) is a first‐line chemotherapy for gastric cancer (GC), but its efficacy is often limited by acquired resistance mediated by upregulation of thymidylate synthase (TS). Sodium butyrate (NaB), a microbiota‐derived short‐chain fatty acid (SCFA), has shown potential in colorectal cancer, but its role in overcoming 5‐FU resistance in GC remains undefined.


Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of NaB in GC cell lines (AGS and KATO‐III) by evaluating cell viability, migration, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, cell cycle, and gene expressions related to DNA synthesis, cell cycle, and cellular stress. NaB decreased cell viability, impaired cellular aggregation, and induced apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, NaB synergized with 5‐FU, enhancing growth inhibition and apoptotic effects. Notably, NaB significantly downregulated TS expression at both mRNA and protein levels and also reduced gene expression such as TK1 and FOXM1. Cell‐cycle analysis indicated distinct responses between AGS (p53‐wild‐type) and KATO‐III (p53‐null) cells.


In conclusion, as a fermentation product of dietary fiber, NaB represents an accessible nutritional adjuvant. Dietary or probiotic strategies to boost systemic butyrate levels could be combined with standard chemotherapy to improve response rates, mitigate resistance, and support patient outcomes in GC.

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of NaB in GC cell lines (AGS and KATO-III) by evaluating cell viability, migration, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, cell cycle, and gene expressions related to DNA synthesis, cell cycle, and cellular stress. NaB decreased cell viability, impaired cellular aggregation, and induced apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, NaB synergized with 5-FU, enhancing growth inhibition and apoptotic effects. Notably, NaB significantly downregulated TS expression at both mRNA and protein levels and also reduced gene expression such as &lt;i&gt;TK1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXM1&lt;/i&gt;. Cell-cycle analysis indicated distinct responses between AGS (p53-wild-type) and KATO-III (p53-null) cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, as a fermentation product of dietary fiber, NaB represents an accessible nutritional adjuvant. Dietary or probiotic strategies to boost systemic butyrate levels could be combined with standard chemotherapy to improve response rates, mitigate resistance, and support patient outcomes in GC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Attenuative Effect of Grifola frondosa (Maitake Mushroom) on Severe DSS‐Induced Colitis in Vitamin D‐Deficient Mice</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the impact of Grifola frondosa (maitake mushroom), a source of fungal vitamin D2, on gut health in mice with vitamin D deficiency. The research focused on how maitake might affect DSS‐induced colitis (an inflammation of the colon) in vitamin D‐deficient mice. Mice were fed different diets for 6 weeks: a control diet, a vitamin D3‐deficient diet, a maitake‐fortified vitamin D3‐deficient diet, or a vitamin D2‐fortified diet. Our findings revealed that maitake consumption increased levels of 25(OH)D2 (a form of vitamin D2) in the mice's plasma, similar to the levels achieved with vitamin D2 supplementation. The expression of genes involved in vitamin D metabolism, such as Cyp24a1 and Cyp27b1, was normalized in the maitake‐fed mice. Additionally, the severe colitis seen in the vitamin D‐deficient mice was significantly reduced in the maitake‐fed group, with improved immune cell profiles and reduced claudin‐2 expression, which is associated with a leaky gut. The attenuative effect of maitake on severe colitis was comparable to supplementation with vitamin D2.








ABSTRACT

Vitamin D deficiency, which has been a global health issue for decades, is involved in gut health and diseases. We examined the health benefits of Grifola frondosa (maitake mushroom), a potent dietary source of fungal vitamin D (D2), on DSS‐induced colitis in vitamin D‐deficient mice. C57BL/6J mice were fed a control diet, vitamin D3‐deficient diet (DD), maitake‐fortified DD, or vitamin D2‐fortified DD for 6 weeks. LC‐MS/MS analysis demonstrated that maitake‐fed mice showed an increased 25(OH)D2 alternative to 25(OH)D3 in plasma, as well as the mice fed an equivalent dose of vitamin D2. The mRNA expression profiles of vitamin D‐responsive genes, including renal Cyp24a1 and Cyp27b1, were normalized in the maitake‐fed mice. Severe DSS‐induced colitis observed in DD mice was attenuated in maitake‐fed mice; the accumulation of immune cells in the colonic mucosa and protein expression of colonic claudin‐2, a target gene of the vitamin D receptor, were comparable to that in control mice. Dietary intake of maitake was effective in improving vitamin D status and biological function, demonstrating a potential attenuative effect on severe DSS‐induced colitis in vitamin D3 deficient mice, as well as equivalent doses of vitamin D2.

         <title>Protective Properties of the White Button Mushroom, Agaricus bisporus, in a Mouse Model of Colitis</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, whole mushroom powder (WMP) from white button mushrooms was tested for gut health benefits. In vitro digested WMP (IVD‐WMP) could reduce the permeability of a gastrointestinal cell layer. In mouse studies, WMP was tested as a preventative and a treatment for dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis. WMP could improve recovery, reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted healthier gut bacteria. This suggests WMP could help support digestive wellness and recovery from gut inflammation.








ABSTRACT

Previous work demonstrated the promising immunomodulatory potential of a naturally derived whole mushroom powder (WMP) from the white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus. Here, we further investigate the protective properties of WMP in a mouse model of colitis. An in vitro digested WMP (IVD‐WMP) reduced permeability of intestinal epithelial Caco‐2 and HT‐29‐MTX cell monolayers to FITC dextran. In vivo, WMP orally administered to mice as a pretreatment before induction of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)‐induced colitis. Though statistically significant decreases in disease scores were not reported, we observed an antiinflammatory and antioxidative stress profile in the colon. Additionally, 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) microbiome analysis revealed differences in bacterial abundance associated with WMP pretreatment, including a decrease in Allobaculum species associated with inflammatory bowel disease. In a DSS‐colitis recovery model, WMP promoted recovery as evidenced by improved weight gain, reduced stool scores, reduced IL‐1β levels, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in colonic tissue. This work demonstrates the health benefits associated with the consumption of the white button mushroom, including support of intestinal barrier integrity combined with antioxidant and antiinflammatory activity.

         <title>α‐Linolenic Acid‐Rich Flaxseed Oil Improves Polycystic Ovary Syndrome via Regulating Lipid Metabolism by GPR120‐cAMP Pathway and Restoring Gut Microecology</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ALA binds to the G protein‐coupled receptor GPR120 and acts on the following the cAMP pathways: (1) cAMP‐Epac‐CTCF pathway and (2) cAMP‐PKA‐CERB pathway, targeting, and regulating lipid synthesis‐related genes Adipod/Cebpa/Fabp4 or Srebf1/Fasn/Pdk4, affecting lipid synthesis and improving PCOS disease.








ABSTRACT
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that affects metabolic and reproductive health in women. α‐Linolenic acid (ALA)–rich flaxseed oil as a dietary food has been suggested to offer potential therapeutic benefits in managing metabolic disturbances associated with PCOS. This study investigates the effects of ALA‐rich flaxseed oil on lipid metabolism and gut microecology in a PCOS rat model. The PCOS model was induced in rats using letrozole, and the animals were then administered ALA‐rich flaxseed oil. Metabolomics, transcriptomics, 16S rRNA sequencing, hormonal levels, and markers of metabolic health were assessed. Results showed that ALA‐rich flaxseed oil significantly improved lipid metabolism by reducing serum cholesterol and triglycerides. In addition, we found that the improvement in lipid metabolism may be associated with the activation of the GPR120‐cAMP pathway. Furthermore, gut microbiota analysis revealed a restoration of gut microbial ecology, with a shift toward a more balanced and healthy microbial composition. ALA‐rich flaxseed oil shows promising potential as a dietary intervention for managing metabolic disturbances in PCOS. Its effects on lipid metabolism and gut microecology highlight its nutritional relevance, offering new insights into the dietary management of PCOS and its associated metabolic disorders.

         <title>Characterization of Phenolics and Influence of Phytic Acid Content on Iron and Zinc Bioaccessibility in Chapati Prepared From Diverse Pearl Millet Genotypes</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thirteen pearl millet genotypes studied to characterize phenolics, free radical scavenging activity, and the effect of phytic acid on iron and zinc bioaccessibility in chapatis. Forty‐three phenolic compounds were identified in different PM genotypes. Higher phenolic levels enhanced free radical scavenging activity; increased phytic acid content reduced mineral bioaccessibility. Phenolics bioaccessibility increased progressively from the oral to gastric to intestinal phase, highlighting the importance of digestion in releasing bioactive compounds.








ABSTRACT
This study investigates the influence of phytic acid on Fe and Zn bioaccessibility and impact of phenolics on free radical scavenging activity in 13 diverse pearl millet (PM) genotypes. Forty‐three phenolic compounds were identified using UPLC‐(ESI)‐QToF‐MS. Free (173.01–217.11 mg GAE/100 g), bound (102.97–142.52 mg GAE/100 g), and total phenolic content (286.04–337.63 mg GAE/100 g) varied significantly among genotypes. Phenolic content positively correlated with radical scavenging activity (36.43%–47.56%, DPPH assay). INFOGEST in vitro digestion showed increasing phenolic bioaccessibility from oral (12.58%–23.55%) to gastric (48.4%–72.25%) to intestinal (67.17%–90.26%) phases. Bioaccessibility of Fe (10.55%–14.46%) and Zn (13.48%–19.79%) was negatively correlated with phytic acid (629.02–797.71 mg/100 g) content. WGI 100, with the lowest phytic acid content, had the highest bioaccessibility, whereas Dedha Bajra, with the highest phytic acid content, had the lowest bioaccessibility of Fe and Zn recorded. PM genotypes are rich in phenolics, having high radical scavenging potential. However, higher phytic acid content reduced Fe and Zn bioaccessibility, reinforcing its antinutritional effect on mineral bioavailability.

Free (173.01–217.11 mg GAE/100 g), bound (102.97–142.52 mg GAE/100 g), and total phenolic content (286.04–337.63 mg GAE/100 g) varied significantly among genotypes. Phenolic content positively correlated with radical scavenging activity (36.43%–47.56%, DPPH assay). INFOGEST in vitro digestion showed increasing phenolic bioaccessibility from oral (12.58%–23.55%) to gastric (48.4%–72.25%) to intestinal (67.17%–90.26%) phases. Bioaccessibility of Fe (10.55%–14.46%) and Zn (13.48%–19.79%) was negatively correlated with phytic acid (629.02–797.71 mg/100 g) content. WGI 100, with the lowest phytic acid content, had the highest bioaccessibility, whereas Dedha Bajra, with the highest phytic acid content, had the lowest bioaccessibility of Fe and Zn recorded. PM genotypes are rich in phenolics, having high radical scavenging potential. However, higher phytic acid content reduced Fe and Zn bioaccessibility, reinforcing its antinutritional effect on mineral bioavailability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impact of the Probiotic on the Modulation of Vaginal Bacterial and Fungal Microbiota in HPV‐Positive Women</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequencing revealed that Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Probio87 modulated the vaginal microbiota by reducing harmful bacteria like Streptococcus and increasing beneficial species such as Lactobacillus jensenii. It also reduced pathogenic fungi like Candida without altering fungal diversity. These changes correlated with improved vulvar comfort and better social interactions, as evidenced by questionnaire results, highlighting Probio87's clinical and psychological benefits for HPV‐positive women.








ABSTRACT

This study examined the effects of administering the probiotic Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Probio87 on the vaginal microbiota of HPV‐positive women, highlighting alterations in bacterial and fungal communities and their potential influence on vaginal and overall health. In a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled study, participants consumed daily doses of Probio87 (1 × 109 CFU/sachet) or a placebo for 12 weeks. Vaginal swabs were collected, and DNA was extracted for 16S rRNA and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region amplification via PCR, followed by sequencing of bacterial and fungal microbiota. The probiotic group showed improved alpha and beta diversity, with an increase in beneficial Lactobacillus (p = 0.014) and Phascolarctobacterium faecium (p = 0.041), while decreasing the abundance of pathogens like Streptococcus and Candida (p = 0.011). Additionally, vaginal health questionnaires linked probiotic use to improved vaginal and mental health in HPV‐positive women. L. plantarum Probio87 demonstrated clinical and psychological benefits in HPV‐positive women by balancing the vaginal microbiome, reducing pathogenic species, and promoting the growth of beneficial microorganisms.

         <title>Association Between Sulfur Microbial Diet With All‐Cause, Cardiovascular Disease, and Cancer Mortality: A Population‐Based Cohort Study</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Higher adherence to the sulfur microbial diet was associated with an increase in all‐cause and cancer mortality.








ABSTRACT

This study aimed to determine the associations between sulfur microbial diet (SMD) and all‐cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer mortality. A total of 91 891 adults were included from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. To evaluate adherence to this dietary pattern, the SMD score was calculated with higher scores indicating greater compliance. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards regression. After a median follow‐up of 15.0 years, 20 706 all‐cause deaths were noted. The participants in the highest quartile of the SMD score had an enhanced risk of death from all causes (HR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.17) and cancer (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.24) than those in the lowest quartile. Dose–response analysis indicated a nonlinear association between the SMD score and both all‐cause and cancer mortality. Subgroup analyses demonstrated a significant positive association between the SMD score and all‐cause mortality in participants aged 65 years and older. Higher adherence to the SMD is linked to increased risks of all‐cause and cancer mortality in the US population. These study findings suggest that intestinal sulfur‐metabolizing bacteria may play a role in the association between diet and health outcomes.

         <title>Low Carbohydrate Diet Containing Soy Protein and Fish Oil Reduces AOM/DSS‐Induced Colon Cancer, in Part, by an Acetate‐Mediated Reduction in TH17 Cell Differentiation</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 15%Amylose/Soy/FO diet dramatically reduces colon tumors compared to a Western diet and this is associated with a reduction in blood glucose, proinflammatory cytokines, prostaglandin E2, and a change in the fecal microbiome. This is accompanied by an increase in fecal acetate and a reduction in interleukin‐17A‐expressing cells within colonic tumors. We suggest that the 15%Amylose/Soy/FO prevents the development of colorectal cancer, in part, by an acetate‐mediated reduction in TH17 cell development.








ABSTRACT
Since our previous studies found a low‐carbohydrate (CHO) diet containing soy protein and fish oil (i.e., 15%Amylose/Soy/FO) significantly reduced tobacco carcinogen‐induced lung nodules in A/J mice, breast tumors in C3(1)/Tag mice, and myelomalignancy in miR‐146a knockout mice, we asked herein if this CHO diet could also reduce colorectal cancer. We tested the efficacy of the 15%Amylose/Soy/FO diet in preventing colitis‐induced colorectal cancer using an azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate BALB/c mouse model. The 15%Amylose/Soy/FO diet significantly reduced colon tumor numbers compared to a Western diet and this was associated with a reduction in blood glucose, and a trend towards an increase in plasma β‐hydroxybutyrate and an increase in liver fatty acid synthase, suggesting a systemic metabolic shift from glucose to fatty acids as an energy source. In addition, our CHO diet reduced proinflammatory cytokines, induced a marked change in the fecal microbiome, an increase in cecal and fecal acetate, and a reduction in interleukin‐17A expressing cells in the colonic tumors of mice on the 15%Amylose/Soy/FO diet. Taken together, our results suggest the 15%Amylose/Soy/FO diet ameliorates colitis and prevents the subsequent development of colorectal cancer, in part by an acetate‐mediated reduction in TH17 cell development.

         <title>Gallic Acid Ameliorates Skeletal Muscle Metabolic Inflexibility by Regulating Lactate Metabolism and Promoting Mitochondrial Function</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallic acid ameliorates high‐fat diet‐induced metabolic disorders in skeletal muscle by enhancing mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation capacity and reducing lactate production and mitochondrial protein lactylation via the LDHA‐lactate axis, ultimately alleviating fat deposition.








ABSTRACT
Obesity‐induced mitochondrial dysfunction impairs skeletal muscle metabolic flexibility. Gallic acid possesses the ability to modulate metabolic homeostasis. This study aimed to investigate the impact of gallic acid on high‐fat diet (HFD)‐induced metabolic disorders in skeletal muscle. Twenty‐four mice were randomly divided into three groups and subjected to HFD and gallic acid intervention for 12 weeks. The overall glycolipid metabolic status, exercise performance, muscle fiber type, and antioxidant capacity of skeletal muscle in HFD‐fed mice treated with gallic acid were assessed. Untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed to evaluate key metabolic characteristics in skeletal muscle. Gallic acid administration effectively reduced fat accumulation, improved exercise capacity, and enhanced antioxidant capacity in HFD‐fed mice. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that gallic acid positively regulated lactate metabolism and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Mechanistically, gallic acid intervention increased fatty acid oxidation capacity while inhibiting lactate production and mitochondrial protein lactylation in skeletal muscle. Moreover, the role of gallic acid in enhancing mitochondrial function through the LDHA‐lactate axis has been demonstrated in C2C12 cells. Collectively, gallic acid ameliorated HFD‐induced metabolic disorders in skeletal muscle, indicating a novel role for gallic acid in ameliorating diet‐induced skeletal muscle metabolic disorders by regulating lactate metabolism and mitochondrial function.

         <title>Carbohydrate Deprivation Improves Glycolipid Metabolism and Activates AMPK/PGC1α Signaling Pathway in Mice</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbohydrate deprivation (NCD) activates AMPK/PGC1α, improving hepatic glycolipid metabolism in mice. NCD reduced blood glucose, HbA1c, LDL‐C, liver glycogen, and lipids after 4 weeks. Metabolomics showed elevated acylcarnitines (enhancing FAO) and reduced LPCs (attenuating lipid toxicity). NCD upregulated pAMPK/pHSL/CPT1A/OXPHOS, promoting lipolysis and FAO while suppressing de novo lipogenesis (SREBP‐1c/FAS), enhancing hepatic energy homeostasis, and mitigating lipid disorders.








ABSTRACT

Scope
Carbohydrate intake profoundly shapes hepatic metabolism, impacting crucial pathways like glycolysis, lipogenesis, and ketogenesis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of carbohydrate deprivation on hepatic glycolipid metabolism in mice.

Male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a 4‐week dietary intervention where they were assigned to one of four groups: standard diet (CON), low‐carbohydrate high‐fat diet (LCD), no‐carbohydrate high‐fat diet (NCD), and high‐carbohydrate no‐fat diet (HCD). Post‐intervention analysis revealed that the NCD group exhibited reduced blood glucose, HbA1c, and LDL‐C levels compared to the CON group. Additionally, the NCD group showed decreased liver glycogen content and liver index. Histopathological examination of liver sections indicated less lipid accumulation and a significant down‐regulation of hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL)‐related proteins in the NCD group. Metabolomics analysis demonstrated higher hepatic acylcarnitine levels and lower lysophosphatidylcholine and fatty acyl metabolites levels in the NCD group. Furthermore, protein expression levels of pAMPK, pHSL, PGC1α, CPT1A, and OXPHOS were elevated in the NCD group, suggesting enhanced hepatic energy metabolism and lipolysis ability.


Conclusion
These findings suggested that carbohydrate deprivation enhances fatty acid metabolism capacity and inhibits lipogenesis via the AMPK/PGC1α pathway to improve glucose and lipid metabolism in mice.

&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrate deprivation (NCD) activates AMPK/PGC1α, improving hepatic glycolipid metabolism in mice. NCD reduced blood glucose, HbA1c, LDL-C, liver glycogen, and lipids after 4 weeks. Metabolomics showed elevated acylcarnitines (enhancing FAO) and reduced LPCs (attenuating lipid toxicity). NCD upregulated pAMPK/pHSL/CPT1A/OXPHOS, promoting lipolysis and FAO while suppressing de novo lipogenesis (SREBP-1c/FAS), enhancing hepatic energy homeostasis, and mitigating lipid disorders.

         <title>The Effect of Chitosan Supplementation on the Gut Microbiota and Various Health Factors in Icelandic Females: A Placebo‐Controlled, Double‐Blind, Randomized Trial</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized, clinical trial investigated the effects of 12‐week chitosan supplementation (3 g/day, LipoSan Ultra) on the gut microbiota and health‐related outcomes in Icelandic females aged 26–70 years, BMI 19.1–35.0 kg/m2. Sixty participants were randomized into a treatment group (TRG, n = 28) or placebo group (PLG, n = 32). Chitosan supplementation led to increased alkaline phosphatase levels, changes in fecal consistency, and significant shifts in gut microbiota composition characterized by decreased diversity, increased Actionobacteriota, and altered abundance of key genera (e.g., reduced Blautia, Eubacterium hallii, increased Ruminococcus gnavus, Bifidobacterium). Despite microbiota modulation, general health markers remained within reference ranges, indicating no adverse health impact. 








ABSTRACT

Chitosan is suggested to have prebiotic properties, yet clinical evidence on its in vivo effects on the human gut microbiota and various health factors remains scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of chitosan supplementation on gut microbiota composition and various health factors in Icelandic females. Sixty Icelandic females (aged 26–70; BMI 19.1–35.0 kg/m2) were randomized to a 12‐week intervention receiving either 3 g/day of encapsulated chitosan (LipoSan Ultra) (TRG, n = 28) or placebo (PLG, n = 32). Anthropometrics, health factors, endurance, and health status questionnaires were collected at baseline (T1) and post‐intervention (T3). All values remained within reference ranges at both timepoints in both groups, except weight, waist circumference, and fat mass, which were above. In TRG, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels increased, and fecal consistency shifted toward constipation. 16S rRNA microbial analysis showed decreased diversity/evenness, increased T1–T3 separation by nonmetric multidimensional scaling, and higher Actinobacteriota abundance. Genus level shifts included reduced Blautia, Eubacterium hallii, CAG‐56 levels and increased Ruminococcus gnavus, Clostridium innocuum, Bifidobacterium, and Holdemania. This novel clinical study demonstrates that 12 weeks of chitosan supplementation alters gut microbiota composition without affecting general health status in females.

         <title>Multistage Metabolomic Analyses Reveal the Differential Effects of Infant Formula and Breast Milk on the Growth and Development of Human Small Intestinal Organoids</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employed in vitro digestion and human small intestinal organoids to simulate nutrient digestion and absorption in infants. Breast milk and various infant formulas were analyzed at three stages: pre‐digestion, post‐digestion, and post‐absorption, representing key phases of early gastrointestinal development. Metabolomics revealed distinct nutrient profiles, offering insights into their potential effects on infant growth and development.








ABSTRACT

The first 6 months of life are crucial for an infant's growth and gastrointestinal development. Proper nutrition is vital to support this maturation, especially considering the limited digestive capacity of infants at this stage. While breast milk is considered the optimal source, infant formula serves as an important alternative for mothers who cannot breastfeed. This study employed human embryonic stem cell‐derived small intestinal organoids (SIOs) to simulate neonatal intestinal digestion and nutrient absorption. Breast milk and different brands of infant formulas were subjected to in vitro digestion and subsequent SIO absorption. Metabolomics analysis was conducted at three stages: predigestion, postdigestion, and postabsorption. Significant differences were found in the metabolic profiles between breast milk and infant formulas at each developmental stage, indicating distinct nutrient processing and absorption patterns. The study highlights the metabolic and absorption variations between breast milk and formula during early infancy. These findings provide important insights into how different nutritional sources influence gastrointestinal development, offering valuable guidance for optimizing infant formula composition to better replicate the benefits of breast milk.

         <title>Association Between Meat Intake and Metabolic Dysfunction‐Associated Steatotic Liver Disease Incidence in a Korean Population From the Health Examinees Study</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the association between meat intake and metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in Koreans. Analyzing data from the Health Examinees (HEXA) study, we found that higher red and processed meat consumption was significantly associated with increased MASLD risk in both sexes. These findings highlight the importance of dietary patterns in MASLD development and suggest potential dietary interventions for MASLD prevention.








ABSTRACT

Scope
This study investigated the limited epidemiological data for Koreans regarding the impact of meat intake on metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), a growing diet‐influenced health concern. We investigated sex‐specific associations of red meat, poultry, and processed meat consumption with MASLD risk using data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study.


Methods and results
The study followed 46 296 participants from the Health Examinees cohort of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, utilizing a validated 106‐item food‐frequency questionnaire to estimate meat intake. Cox proportional hazard models, adjusted for confounders, were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for MASLD risk. The high total meat intake significantly increased MASLD risk by 40% in men (HR 1.40; 95% CI 1.09–1.80) and 52% in women (HR 1.52; 95% CI 1.18–1.96). Red meat consumption elevated risk by 34% in men (HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.04–1.73) and 43% in women (HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.12–1.83). Processed meat intake also increased risk by 32% in men (HR 1.32; 95% CI 1.12–1.55) and 50% in women (HR 1.50; 95% CI 1.23–1.82).


Conclusion
The findings indicate that red and processed meat consumption substantially elevates MASLD risk in Koreans.

         <title>Prolonged Fructose Overconsumption Activates Original Biosynthetic and Metabolic Pathways of Endogenous Purine in Rats</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study made a pioneering endeavor to unravel the potential mechanistic link between prolonged fructose overconsumption and the incidence of hyperuricemia (HUA). Long‐term high‐fructose (30%) intake remarkably increased the levels of uric acid, creatinine, and urea in rats. Chronic ingestion of high‐fructose contributed to HUA, which was intimately associated with activation of original biosynthetic and metabolic pathways of endogenous purine simultaneously mediated by pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), de novo purine biosynthesis (DNPB) and XOD, and accompanied by bioenergetic alteration.








ABSTRACT
Fructose is a nutrient used widely and indiscriminately as a sweetener in various types of foods and beverages. Accumulating evidence suggests that dietary fructose has a close relationship with metabolic diseases like hyperuricemia (HUA). However, the role and metabolic fate of fructose intake remain elusively obscure. The present work made a pioneering endeavor to unravel the potential mechanistic link between prolonged fructose overconsumption and the incidence of HUA. High‐fructose (30%) free drinking was provided to rats for 17 weeks. Results indicated that long‐term high‐fructose intake remarkably increased the levels of uric acid, creatinine, and urea. Besides, mild renal alteration induced by high fructose was observed in the hyperuricemic rats. Instead of activating ketohexokinase, high‐fructose intake activated the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to produce abundant ribose 5‐phosphate and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. The de novo purine biosynthesis (DNPB) was activated to produce purines and accelerate the purine cycle. High‐fructose intake significantly enhanced the expression of core enzymes of DNPB and changed the purinosome formation and forming areas. Furthermore, up‐regulation of xanthine oxidase (XOD) promoted the purine metabolism, resulting in increased levels of inosine monophosphate, inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine. Besides, the targeted metabolome analysis also showed that fructose metabolism triggered bioenergetic alteration with the consumption of ATP and a surge in NAD+ and NADH. Hence, chronic ingestion of high‐fructose contributed to HUA, which was intimately associated with activation of original biosynthetic and metabolic pathways of endogenous purine simultaneously mediated by PPP, DNPB, and XOD and accompanied by bioenergetic alteration.

&lt;p&gt;Fructose is a nutrient used widely and indiscriminately as a sweetener in various types of foods and beverages. Accumulating evidence suggests that dietary fructose has a close relationship with metabolic diseases like hyperuricemia (HUA). However, the role and metabolic fate of fructose intake remain elusively obscure. The present work made a pioneering endeavor to unravel the potential mechanistic link between prolonged fructose overconsumption and the incidence of HUA. High-fructose (30%) free drinking was provided to rats for 17 weeks. Results indicated that long-term high-fructose intake remarkably increased the levels of uric acid, creatinine, and urea. Besides, mild renal alteration induced by high fructose was observed in the hyperuricemic rats. Instead of activating ketohexokinase, high-fructose intake activated the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to produce abundant ribose 5-phosphate and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. The de novo purine biosynthesis (DNPB) was activated to produce purines and accelerate the purine cycle. High-fructose intake significantly enhanced the expression of core enzymes of DNPB and changed the purinosome formation and forming areas. Furthermore, up-regulation of xanthine oxidase (XOD) promoted the purine metabolism, resulting in increased levels of inosine monophosphate, inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine. Besides, the targeted metabolome analysis also showed that fructose metabolism triggered bioenergetic alteration with the consumption of ATP and a surge in NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NADH. Hence, chronic ingestion of high-fructose contributed to HUA, which was intimately associated with activation of original biosynthetic and metabolic pathways of endogenous purine simultaneously mediated by PPP, DNPB, and XOD and accompanied by bioenergetic alteration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking Corn Silk's Potential: Bioactive Compounds Targeting Age‐Related Diseases</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the health benefits of corn silk, highlighting its flavonoids and polysaccharides. It examines their antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and metabolic‐regulating effects, which contribute to its potential in managing aging‐related diseases, including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders.








ABSTRACT
Corn silk, the stigmas and styles of maize, is a traditional medicinal herb with promising anti‐aging potential. This review systematically examines its bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, polysaccharides, terpenoids, and sterols, which contribute to its antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, anti‐tumor, and metabolic regulatory effects. These properties support its potential therapeutic applications in aging‐related conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's), cardiovascular disorders, metabolic diseases (e.g., diabetes and obesity), and kidney dysfunction. Preclinical studies highlight corn silk's role in mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation—key drivers of aging. Additionally, preliminary clinical trials, particularly on its anti‐diabetic effects, show promise, but larger randomized controlled trials are needed to establish its safety and efficacy. Future research should focus on standardizing extraction methods, elucidating mechanisms of action, and exploring synergistic interactions among its bioactive constituents. Together, this review emphasizes the need for continued investigation into corn silk as a natural, multi‐target therapeutic agent for aging and age‐related diseases, and advancing its potential for clinical applications.

         <title>Photoperiod‐Dependent Effects of Phenolic‐Enriched Fruit Extracts on Postprandial Triacylglyceride Levels and Acute Inflammatory Responses in F344 Rats</title>
         <description>Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp;Food Research, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the photoperiod‐dependent effects of eight phenolic‐rich fruit extracts on postprandial blood triacylglyceride (TAG) levels and serum inflammatory markers in F344 rats, following an oral lipid tolerance test (OLTT) and a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‐induced inflammatory challenge. Results showed that cherry and plum extracts reduced TAG levels under short photoperiod conditions (L6), while winter‐fruit and strawberry extracts were most effective at lowering proinflammatory markers, with effects varying depending on the photoperiod of administration.

ABSTRACT
This study investigated the photoperiod‐dependent effects of eight phenolic‐enriched fruit extracts on postprandial blood triacylglyceride (TAG) levels and serum cytokine and CRP levels in F344 rats after an oral lipid tolerance test (OLTT) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–induced inflammatory challenge, respectively. Animals were exposed to short (6‐h light, L6) or long (18‐h light, L18) photoperiods and orally supplemented with fruit extracts (100 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. Extracts were obtained from seasonal fruits (cherries, plums, apricots, strawberries, persimmon kakis, grapes, oranges, and pomegranates). Temporal homeostasis disruption was induced by an OLTT and LPS challenge. No differences in blood postprandial TAG levels were observed in the L6‐ and L12‐control groups. However, in the experimental groups, the postprandial TAG response depended on the photoperiod and fruit extract consumption, mainly cherry and plum extracts in L6 (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, control rats exposed to L6 exhibited higher blood IL‐6 and TNF‐α levels after inducing LPS‐inflammatory response. Notably, winter‐fruit and strawberry extracts were the most efficient at lowering proinflammatory cytokines. These findings show the effectiveness of specific fruit extracts in modulating postprandial TAG levels and acute inflammatory responses, being their effects photoperiod‐dependent, opening the door to the design of functional ingredients specific for each season.
